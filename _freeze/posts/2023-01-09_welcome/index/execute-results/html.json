These posts will be hosted on this [pharmaverse blog](https://pharmaverse.github.io/comms_wg/) and promoted on the pharmaverse slack channels as well as on LinkedIn.\n\nAs the CWG is a small team, we hope to make the blog development process easy enough that pharmaverse community members will be able to easily write blog posts with guidance from the CWG team.\n\n## Spirit of a Blog Post\n\nThe CWG believes that the following 4 points will help guide the creation of Blog Posts. \n\n* **Short**\n* **Personalized**\n* **Reproducible**\n* **Readable**  \n\n**Short:** Posts should aim to be under a 10 minute read. We encourage longer posts to be broken up into multiple posts.  \n\n**Personalized:** Posts should have a personality! For example, a person wishing to post on a function in a package needs to differentiate the post from the documentation for function, i.e. we don't want to just recycle the documentation. How can you add your voice and experience? A bit of cheeky language is also encouraged.\n\n**Reproducible:**  Posts should work with minimal dependencies with data, packages and outside sources. Every dependency introduced in a post adds some risk to the post longevity. As package dependencies change, posts should be built in a way that they can be updated to stay relevant.\n\n**Readable:** The CWG sees this site as more of introductory site rather advanced user site. Therefore, the CWG feels that code should be introduced in a way that promotes readability over complexity. \n\n\n## What types of posts are allowed on this site?\n\nOverall, we want to stay focus on the Clinical Reporting Pipeline, which we see as the following topics:\n\n1) Packages in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline\n2) Functions from packages in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline\n3) Wider experiences of using R in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline\n4) Conference experiences and the Clinical Reporting Pipeline\n\nHowever, it never hurts to ask if you topic might fit into this medium!.\n\n### Minimum Post Requirements\n\n  * A unique image to help showcase the post.\n  * Working Code\n  * Self-contained data or package data.\n  * Documentation of package versions\n\nThat is it! After that you can go wild, but we do ask that it is kept short!\n\n## How can I make a Blog Post\n\nStep 1: Reach out to us through [pharmaverse/slack](pharmaverse.slack.com\n) or make an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/comms_wg/issues).\n\nStep 2: Branch off `main`\n\nStep 3: Review the Spirit of the Blog Post in the Pull Request Template\n\nStep 4: Poke us to do a review!  \n\n\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n## Last updated {.appendix}\n \n2023-06-19 21:18:50 UTC\n \n## Details {.appendix}\n \n[source code](https://github.com/https://github.com/pharmaverse/comms_wg/tree/main/posts/2023-01-09_welcome/index.qmd), [R environment](https://github.com/https://github.com/pharmaverse/comms_wg/tree/main/posts/2023-01-09_welcome/renv.lock)\n:::\n:::\n",
