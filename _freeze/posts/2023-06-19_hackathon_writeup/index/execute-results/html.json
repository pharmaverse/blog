\"2023-06-19\"\ncategories: [community, admiral]\nimage: \"community.png\"\n---\n\n\n<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThis January and February (2023), the `admiral` development team and the CDISC Open Source Alliance jointly hosted the admiral hackathon.\nThe idea was to build a community of `admiral` users, and help participants familiarize themselves with R and `admiral`.\nThis whole effort was led by [Thomas Neitmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasneitmann/) and was supported by [Zelos Zhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zelos-zhu-7969a1103/), [Sadchla Mascary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadchla-mascary/), and me -- [Stefan Thoma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-thoma-77537bb5/).\n\nThe hackathon event was structured in two parts.\nFirst, we offered an *Introduction to R* for SAS programmers, a three hour workshop for R beginners to get them up to speed.\nHere we covered practical R basics, talking about how the R-workflow differs from a SAS workflow, and discussed common R functions - mostly from the tidyverse.\nThis ensured that hackathon participants were familiar with core R concepts.\nThe [workshop recording](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/pre-admiral-hackathon-workshop-introduction-r-sas-programmers) and the [course materials](https://pharmaverse.github.io/intro-to-r-for-sas-programmers-workshop/) are available online.\n\nThe main hackathon consisted of several ADAM data generating tasks based on a specs file and synthetic data.\nParticipants were able to solve these tasks in groups at their own pace thanks to a online tool where participants could upload their task specific R scripts and they would get automatic feedback for the data-set produced by their script.\nScript upload through [the feedback application](https://zxqguo-stefan0pascal-thoma.shinyapps.io/data_upload/) was available all through February, and we offered three additional online meetings throughout the month to discuss challenges and give some tips.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the thoughts that went into the feedback application, you can read about it in [this blogpost](https://pharmaverse.github.io/comms_wg/posts/2023-03-14_hackathon_app/) or check out my [public GitHub repository for such an application](https://github.com/StefanThoma/hackathon_app).\n\n\n\n\n\n## *Introduction to R* workshop\n\nWe were really excited to see over **500** people from around 40 countries joining our *introduction to R workshop* in January!\nTo get to know prospective users and hackathon participants better, we conducted some polls during the meetings.\nBelow you can see that representatives of many different sorts of organisations joined our *Introduction to R* workshop:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n216 out of 402 confirmed that their company is already using R for clinial trial data analysis, the remaining 131 did not answer this question.\n\nThe target audience for this workshop were programmers who are very familiar with SAS, but not so familiar with R, our polls confirmed this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOverall, we were very happy with how the workshop turned out, and participants overall agreed with this sentiment (although there may be a slight [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)...).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## `admiral` Hackathon\n\nFollowing the kick-off meeting, 371 participants joined the posit (rStudio) workspace that was made available to all participants at no costs by the [posit company](https://posit.co/).\nAbout half the participants planned to spend one to two hours per week on the admiral tasks, the other half planned to allocate even more.\n15 participants even planned to spend eight hours or more!\n\nWe were really happy to see an overwhelming amount of activity on the slack channel we set up with over 250 members.\nNot only were people engaging with the materials, but we saw how a community was formed where people were encouraged to ask questions and where community members went out of their way to help each other.\nShout-out to our community hero: [Jagadish Katam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagadishkatam/) without whom most issues related to the task programming raised by the community would not have been addressed as quickly as they were.\nHuge thanks from the organizers!\n\nIn the end, a total of 44 teams spanning 87 statistical programmers took part in the admiral hackathon and uploaded solution scripts to the hackathon application solving at least one of the 8 tasks available (ADSL, ADAE, ADLBC, ADVS, ADTTE, ADADAS, ADLBH & ADLBHY).\nParticipants' scripts were then run on the shiny server and the output data-frame were compared to the solutions we provided.\nAt the read-out there was a live draft of teams to win one-on-one `admiral` consulting with one of the `admiral` core developers.\nWinning probabilities were weighted by the number of points each group received for the quality of their output data-frames and for the number of tasks solved.\n\nCongratulations to the winners:\n\n-   `ViiV Team_GSK`\n-   `teamspoRt`\n-   `TatianaPXL`\n-   `Divyasneelam`\n-   `AdaMTeamIndia`\n-   `Sanofi_BP`\n-    `Jagadish` (our community hero)\n-   `AZ_WAWA`\n\nAlthough this was uncertain during the hackathon we were excited to provide a Certificate of Completion to all participants who uploaded a script to the Web Application.\n\nA recording of the hackathon readout can be found in the [CDISC Open Source Alliance Quarterly Spotlight](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/cosa-quarterly-spotlight-q1-2023).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, we are very happy with how the hackathon turned out.\nWe were not only positively surprised with the huge audience for the *Intro to R* workshop (CDISC record breaking) and for the `admiral` hackathon, but even more so with the engagement of all the participants.\n\nAgain, we would like to thank all the organizers, participants, and sponsors for their time and resources and hope to have provided a useful glimpse into our solution for ADAM creation within the end-to-end clinical data analysis open source R framework that the Pharmaverse aims to provide.\n\n\nAs always, we are very happy to hear more feedback on the hackathon as well as on `admiral` in general.\nSimply submit an issue on the [`admiral` GitHub repository](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral).\nYou would like to join the `admiral` core developers?\nPlease reach out to [Edoardo Mancini (product owner)](mailto:edoardo.mancini@roche.com) or [Ben Straub (technical lead)](mailto:ben.x.straub@gsk.com).\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
