### A New Opportunity for `teal` Developers at the Posit Shiny Contest 2024

We're thrilled to announce that `teal` is collaborating with Posit for the 2024 Shiny Contest, offering a fantastic opportunity for `teal` users to showcase their skills.

This year, you can stand out by submitting a `teal` app and even win the new developer award!
Whether you're a seasoned `teal` user or just starting, this is your moment to shine.

To further support our `teal` community during this event, we'd like to mention two things:

1.  [`random.cdisc.data` R package](https://insightsengineering.github.io/random.cdisc.data/) \
    To help you create impactful apps without worrying about sensitive data exposure, we’d like to introduce the `random.cdisc.data` R package.
    This package is designed to generate random CDISC data, which is particularly useful when creating `teal` apps that require CDISC data formats.
    \
    With ready-to-use datasets offered by the package, you can focus more on building your app and less on data preparation.

2.  Explore the [teal.gallery repo](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.gallery) \
    We highly recommend `teal` users check out the `teal.gallery` repo, where you’ll find example apps that leverage `random.cdisc.data` to showcase `teal`’s capabilities. It’s also a great resource for exploring and discovering what `teal` can do for you.

The deadline for the submission is **September 15**, so mark your calendar and start building your teal app today!
