We are excited to announce that **Appsilon** and **Sanofi** will take up the remaining two open council seats on the pharmaverse council!

Appsilon will on the council be represented by [**Damian Rodziewicz**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drodziewicz/) and Sanofi by [**Andre Couturier**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-couturier-1800b447/).

# Appsilon and Open Source

Appsilon is the maintainer of the [`rhino`](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/) package already on the pharmaverse package roster, as well as having numerous employees contributing to pharmaverse in spaces such as TLG packages and our [Examples site](https://pharmaverse.github.io/examples/).
Appsilon also powers the popular [ShinyConf](https://www.shinyconf.com/) and are involved in the pilot submissions to FDA through the R consortium working group ["R for submission"](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Sanofi and Open Source

Sanofi recently became a member of the R consortium and have in recent years invested heavily in the adoption of R internally.
In line with the pharmaverse goal, Sanofi is committed to the adoption and further development of open source software in the pharma industry.
This is evident through Sanofi's contributions to [`falcon`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/falcon/) and [`riskmetric`](https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/) and their [extension](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/2024/Connect/US/Bethesda/PAP_ET10.pdf) of the [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/latest-tag/) framework, which they are working towards open sourcing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Becoming a member of the pharmaverse council means that the companies are committing to our [charter](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/council/) and specifically:

-   *"Commitment to at least 2 open source packages under pharmaverse via reviews, hands-on code development, product leads, or other roles which contribute to the design, development, testing, release, and/or maintenance"*

Both companies will bring both deep technical knowledge and knowledge on R adoption into pharmaverse.

We are excited to further develop the open source eco-system for pharma!
