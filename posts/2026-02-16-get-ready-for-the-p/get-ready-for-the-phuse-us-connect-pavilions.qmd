Howdy, Phriends!

In case you missed it - there is a massive PHUSE Connect coming up soon in Austin, Texas!
What's so massive about it?
There's so much content planned that we've extended it by a full day!
I guess it's true what they say - Everything's bigger in Texas!

One of the many expansions is the innovation of the four [PHUSE Pavilions](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=73387&ef_sel_menu=5382&eventID=88)^TM^ to grab your interest:

-   Data Transparency ([agenda](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=81398&eventID=88&eventID=88 "Data Transparency"))

-   Open Source ([agenda](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=81492&ef_sel_menu=5790&eventID=88&eventID=88&eventID=88 "Open Source"))

-   Real-World Evidence ([agenda](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=81485&ef_sel_menu=5789&eventID=88&eventID=88&eventID=88 "Real-World Evidence"))

-   Vulcan FHIR Forge ([agenda](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=81503&ef_sel_menu=5802&eventID=88&eventID=88 "Vulcan FHIR Forge"))

And what's the best part?
They are all [**FREE**]{.underline} with your Connect ticket!
No additional fee.
No additional registration.
Thanks to our Pavilion Sponsors, all of this focused and expert-provided content is available to PHUSE attendees and included in your 2026 PHUSE US Connect registration.

And for those interested in [pharmaverse]{.underline}, you'll find contributors and Council members in the room for the Open Source Pavilion.
Whether it's facilitating a workshop on **Metadata-Driven Automation**, on the panel on **Open Source Change Management**, facilitating a workshop on **AI in Clinical Data Analysis,** or making connections at our novel **Open Source in Pharma Block Party** - [**pharmaverse**](https://pharmaverse.org/) will be present and engaged.
And, this is just the Open Source Pavilion agenda - taking place over 2 of the 4 days and in just one of the 10 concurrent rooms of activity.
That's TEN - One-Zero - you know, like the ten-gallon hat?

So, saddle up and get ready!
We ain't horsin' around this time.
See you in Austin!

Michael Rimler, PHUSE Open Source Director
