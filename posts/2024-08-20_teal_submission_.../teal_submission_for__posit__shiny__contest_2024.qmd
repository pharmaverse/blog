### A New Opportunity for `teal` Developers at the Posit Shiny Contest 2024

We're thrilled to announce that [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) is collaborating with Posit for the 2024 Shiny Contest, offering a fantastic opportunity for developers to showcase their skills.

This year, you can stand out by submitting a [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) app and even win the new developer award!
Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this is your moment to shine.

To further support our community during this event, we'd like to mention two things:

1.  [`random.cdisc.data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/random.cdisc.data/) R package\
    To help you create [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) app without worrying about sensitive data exposure, we’d like to introduce the [`random.cdisc.data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/random.cdisc.data/) R package.
    This package is designed to generate random CDISC data, which is particularly useful when creating [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) apps that require CDISC data formats.
    \
    With ready-to-use datasets offered by the package, you can focus more on building your app and less on data preparation.

2.  Explore the [`teal.gallery`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.gallery) repository\
    We highly recommend to check out the [`teal.gallery`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.gallery) repo, where you’ll find example apps that leverage [`random.cdisc.data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/random.cdisc.data/) to showcase teal’s capabilities. It’s also a great resource for exploring and discovering what [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) can do for you.

The deadline for the submission is **September 15**, so mark your calendar and start building your teal app today!

<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
