# Introduction

{admiralneuro} joins the family as the latest {admiral} extension package.
The package supports neurological disease areas, with the initial release of version 0.1.0 focusing on Alzheimer's disease.

The package was born out of a collaboration between Eli Lilly, Roche, Cytel, GSK, and contributors from the wider industry. The package maintainer is Jian Wang (Eli Lilly).
