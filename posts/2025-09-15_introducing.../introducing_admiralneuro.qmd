# Introduction

{admiralneuro} joins the family as the latest {admiral} extension package.
The package supports neurological disease areas, with the initial release of version 0.1.0 focusing on Alzheimer's disease.

The package was born out of a collaboration between Eli Lilly, Roche, Cytel, GSK, and contributors from the wider industry.

# Package Contents

In the 0.1.0 release, {admiralneuro} provides the following:

-   Alzheimer's-specific SDTM test data - this will be moved to {pharmaversesdtm} for the 0.2.0 release of {admiralneuro}
    -   [DM](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/blob/main/data-raw/dm_neuro.R) - Demographics dataset including age-appropriate Alzheimer's patients
    -   [NV](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/blob/main/data-raw/nv_neuro.R) - Neurological exams dataset including amyloid and tau PET scans at baseline and two follow-up visits
    -   [SUPPNV](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/blob/main/data-raw/suppnv_neuro.R)- Supplemental neurological exams dataset including reference regions used for SUVR calculations
    -   [AG](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/blob/main/data-raw/ag_neuro.R) - Agents dataset including tracer details for amyloid and tau PET scans
-   A brand-new function admiralneuro::compute_centiloid() that computes Centiloid values based on amyloid PET tracer, SUVR pipeline, and reference region
-   Two template programs for [ADAPET](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/blob/main/inst/templates/ad_adapet.R) and [ADTPET](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralneuro/blob/main/inst/templates/ad_adtpet.R)
-   A corresponding [Creating ADTPET and ADAPET Vignette](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralneuro/articles/adpet.html)

### `compute_centiloid()`

The Centiloid scale is a standardized quantitative measure for amyloid PET imaging that allows comparison between different tracers and analysis methods.
It is calculated as:

$Centiloid = slope*SUVR + intercept$

where SUVR is a patient's Standardized Uptake Value Ratio.

The admiralneuro::compute_centiloid() function neatly computes Centiloid values from SUVR values given a specific combination of tracer, SUVR pipeline, and reference region in order to define slope and intercept.
Currently, the following combinations of **tracer**, **pipeline**, and **ref_region** are supported:

|                 |                            |                  |        |           |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| tracer          | pipeline                   | ref_region       | slope  | intercept |
| 18F-Florbetapir | AVID FBP SUVR PIPELINE     | Whole Cerebellum | 183.07 | -177.26   |
| 18F-Florbetaben | AVID FBB SUVR PIPELINE     | Whole Cerebellum | 156.06 | -148.13   |
| 18F-Florbetapir | BERKELEY FBP SUVR PIPELINE | Whole Cerebellum | 188.22 | -189.16   |
| 18F-Florbetaben | BERKELEY FBB SUVR PIPELINE | Whole Cerebellum | 157.15 | -151.87   |

\
Here is an example of the function in action:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(admiral)
library(admiralneuro)
library(dplyr)

adapet_example <- admiralneuro::admiralneuro_adapet %>%
  filter(PARAMCD == "SUVRBFBB")

adapet_example <- adapet_example %>%
  admiral::derive_param_computed(
    by_vars = c(
      get_admiral_option("subject_keys"),
      exprs(ADT, ADY, VISIT)
    ),
    parameters = c("SUVRBFBB"),
    set_values_to = exprs(
      AVAL = compute_centiloid(
        tracer = "18F-Florbetaben",
        pipeline = "BERKELEY FBB SUVR PIPELINE",
        ref_region = "Whole Cerebellum",
        suvr = AVAL
      ),
      PARAMCD = "CENTLD",
      PARAM = "Centiloid value derived from SUVR pipeline",
      AVALU = "CL"
    )
  )
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(admiraldev)
dataset_vignette(adapet_example %>% filter(PARAMCD == "CENTLD") %>% arrange(USUBJID, ADT), display_vars = exprs(USUBJID, PARAMCD, PARAM, VISIT, AVAL, AVALU))
```

\
Alternatively, the user can specify a custom slope and intercept to the function using the **custom_slope** and **custom_intercept** parameters.

Note that support for additional combinations of tracers, pipelines, and reference regions may be added in the future as needed.
See [Iaccarino, L. et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2025.103765) for more Centiloid transformation formulas.

### Templates and Vignette

The {admiralneuro} package website contains the [Creating ADTPET and ADAPET Vignette](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralneuro/articles/adpet.html) which guides users through the creation of both ADTPET (Tau PET) and ADAPET (Amyloid PET) ADaM datasets.
This covers the use of the admiralneuro::compute_centiloid() function above, as well as other therapeutic area-specific considerations for these BDS datasets such as derivation of criterion flag variables for Centiloid categories.

The vignette accompanies the ADTPET and ADAPET template scripts, which can be used as a starting point for creating these ADaM datasets.
These scripts can be loaded and saved directly from the R console by running either of the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
use_ad_template("ADTPET", package = "admiralneuro")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
use_ad_template("ADAPET", package = "admiralneuro")
```

# Conclusion

We’re excited to share the first release of {admiralneuro}, and we hope it will be a valuable resource for those working in the Alzheimer’s disease space.
We look forward to expanding the package in future releases to include alpha-synuclein pathology, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease that is also found in other neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease.
We’ll also be adding functions to explore olfactory impairment, a fascinating early signal connected to both Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

As with all pharmaverse packages, community feedback is not only welcomed but encouraged so that development remains in a direction that is relevant and useful!
