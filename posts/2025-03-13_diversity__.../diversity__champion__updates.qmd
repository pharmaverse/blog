I am excited to announce that the pharmaverse council has approved additional organizational characteristics required for council membership. These criteria establish the level of DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) commitment we expect from council member organizations. This additional text is shown here and also linked:

In other exciting news, pharmaverse is now fully supported under PHUSE as a working group. Pharmaverse council members will now be expected to follow the [*Code of Conduct*](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Communications/Forms/PHUSE+Code+of+Conduct+-+V2+March+2023.pdf) for PHUSE. Both PHUSE and pharmaverse would expect the same from any PHUSE community member contributing to working group projects under pharmaverse. 

I would also like to update the community on other activities. Recently I conducted a council survey and I intend to provide a community survey soon. As a data driven person myself, I feel it is important we take the time to understand our community as it is today and use that data to help create appropriate and achievable goals. Keep an eye out for the survey when it is published and I look forward to sharing the results with the community! Lastly, I plan to open some supportive roles to pharmaverseâ€™s DEI landscape. Iâ€™ll be seeking people who are generally interested in this space and also want to use their coding skills to maybe do fun things with data. ðŸ˜Š
