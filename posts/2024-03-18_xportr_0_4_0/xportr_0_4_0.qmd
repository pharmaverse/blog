# `XPT` Meets [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/)!

`XPT` datasets are binary files typically created by SAS software. They contain structured data, including variables, labels, and metadata, and are crucial for data exchange and regulatory submissions in industries such as pharmaceuticals and healthcare. By using  [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/), programmers are able to build these CDISC compliant files in R. 

# What is [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/)?

[`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) has been developed through collaborations between developers from different parts of the industry. This collaborative effort ensures that [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) meets the diverse needs and requirements of users across various domains. By leveraging insights and expertise from different stakeholders, [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) continues to evolve and improve, maintaining its relevance and effectiveness in the ever-changing landscape of data management and analysis. [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) is currently on version 0.4.0 and you can keep up with all of its improvements by follow reading the [`Changelog`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/news/index.html)

# Why [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/)?

[`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) is an essential R package for generating `xpt` datasets. This package have functions to apply metadata information to your CDISC compliant datasets that were created in R , perform checks and provide useful feedbacks. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the capabilities of [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/), its development, and the future trends of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and `xpt` datasets.

# How does it work?

You too can experience some of the benefits of [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) by taking a [`deep dive`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/articles/deepdive.html) at [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/)!

There are data deliverables and supporting documentation needed for a successful submission to Health Authorities, while you can find a walk through on how you can use `xportr` [`here`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/articles/deepdive.html#what-goes-in-a-submission-to-a-health-authority), let's look at a high level example:

```{r,  message = FALSE, echo = FALSE }
library(xportr)
library(magrittr)
```

Looking at an `adsl` and the define metadata information
```{r,  message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE }
adsl <- data.frame(
  Subj = as.character(123, 456, 789),
  Different = c("a", "b", "c"),
  Val = c("1", "2", "3"),
  Param = c("param1", "param2", "param3")
)
```

and the define metadata information
```{r,  message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
metadata <- data.frame(
  dataset = "test",
  variable = c("Subj", "Param", "Val", "NotUsed"),
  type = c("numeric", "character", "numeric", "character"),
  format = NA,
  order = c(1, 3, 4, 2)
)
```

Users can use the [`xportr_metadata()`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/reference/xportr_metadata.html) function in combination with [`xportr_type()`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/reference/xportr_type.html) and [`xportr_order()`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/reference/xportr_order.html) to not only apply the metadata to your data but also do valuable checks and receive feedbacks on your data based on your spec.

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
adsl %>%
  xportr_metadata(metadata, "test") %>%
  xportr_type() %>%
  xportr_order()
```
You can also use additional functions like [`xportr_write()`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/reference/xportr_write.html) to generate your `xpt` file.

# Key Features of [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/):

- **Efficient Handling**: [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) offers efficient handling of `xpt` files, allowing users to export in `xpt` format, and manipulate large datasets with ease.
- **Compatibility**: [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) ensures compatibility with various data types and formats commonly used in `xpt` files, ensuring seamless data exchange across different systems.
- **Data Integrity**: [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) preserves data integrity by retaining variable labels, formats, and other metadata during data export operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: [`xportr`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive functions for generating `xpt` datasets and performing data manipulation tasks.

# Is The Future `XPT` or JSON?

`XPT` datasets are standardized, structured files used for storing clinical trial data, making them essential for regulatory submissions and data analysis. They remain indispensable in certain industries and with advancements in data management and analysis tools, the future of `xpt` datasets lies in improved efficiency, compatibility, and ensuring seamless integration with emerging technologies and data formats.

As data continues to play a central role in decision-making and innovation, the future of JSON datasets are worth exploring. JSON datasets offer flexibility, simplicity, and interoperability, making them increasingly popular for data storage and exchange. JSON's lightweight and human-readable format make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including web development, APIs, IoT, and data storage. While `xpt` datasets remain prevalent in certain industries, there's a growing interest in JSON datasets across various domains.
