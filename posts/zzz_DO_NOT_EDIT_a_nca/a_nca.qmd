### What is [aNCA](https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA)?

The [aNCA](https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA) package is an open source tool developed in collaboration between Roche, Appsilon, and Human Predictions. This new addition to the [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) is designed to simplify Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA), making it more accessible for all scientists across industries.

### **The aNCA package empowers users to:**

-   Perform NCA on both non-clinical and clinical data
-   Automatically calculate PK parameters for various dosing regimens
-   Conduct manual selections and exclusions for lambda-z regression
-   Visualize results dynamically with editable plots and summary tables
-   Export PK parameters into a comprehensive, ready-to-use reports

This tool is built using `shiny` with user-friendliness in mind, allowing both novice and experienced users to seamlessly integrate it into their workflows.


### **Get Started!**

To try out the package, head to the [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA) repository and follow the installation steps. There you can also find how to contribute or share feedback with us (don't forget to star the project if you like it!). Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of open-source tools!

<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
