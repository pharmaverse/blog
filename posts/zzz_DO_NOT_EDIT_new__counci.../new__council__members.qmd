Hi pharmaverse community,

On behalf of the council we wanted to update you on 2 council members who are
passing on the baton to new representatives from their respective companies.

Firstly, Michael Rimler (who is one of our original co-founders) will transition
council responsibilities for GSK to Alice Ehmann. Michael will never be too far
away though, as he maintains his role on the PHUSE board as Open Source
Technologies Director. His passion, creativity and ambition were one of the key
reasons we have such a thriving pharmaverse suite of open source solutions and
the community we see today.

Alice joins having previously being a package lead and contributor for `{admiral}`
and as a Programming Leader in GSK is enthusiastically spear-heading adoption of
R and open source solutions.

Secondly, Damian Rodziewicz is handing over the Appsilon council representative
role to Marcin Dubel. Damian has brought such enthusiasm to our council during
his term and has helped us to expand our outreach. We'll miss his level-headed
and pragmatic style, and how he always championed the everyday users of
pharmaverse packages.

Marcin is the Head of Technology at Appsilon, so will bring extra technical
skill depth to the council and will continue in Damian's great example.

Please join us in thanking Michael and Damian for all they've done for our
community, and welcome to Alice and Marcin!

of us using: pharmaverse.council@phuse.global.
