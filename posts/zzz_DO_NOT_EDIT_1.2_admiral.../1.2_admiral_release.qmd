# Introduction

As crazy as it may sound, the {admiral} package is nearing its third CRAN birthday: our first release dates all the way back to the 17th February 2022! Time really does fly when you're programming ADaMs, and our codebase has grown __massively__ since then. For some context, if you'd only allowed yourself to write twenty lines of code a day, starting from the 17th February 2022, by now you would have compiled the whole of the {admiral} codebase (excluding documentation and unit tests - who needs those anyway?). And so, what better early birthday present for {admiral} than the new and exciting 1.2 release? Read through this blog post to find out more about the exciting contents of this release, as well some of our plans for 2025.

# New Features for 1.2

As always, we have listed the full set of 1.2 updates in our [changelog](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/news/index.html), and have picked out only a select few to discuss within this post.

The two new functions available in this release are:

* admiral::derive_vars_cat(): Derive Categorization Variables Like AVALCATy and AVALCAyN
* admiral::derive_vars_crit_flag():  Derives ADaM compliant criterion flags, e.g., to facilitate subgroup analyses.
* admiral::transform_scale(): blah blah

## New function: admiral::derive_vars_cat()

  values_yn = TRUE,
  create_numeric_flag = TRUE
)
```

## New function: admiral::transform_scale()

The final new function we are adding is admiral::transform_scale(). Coming directly from a user request, with this function we now have functionality to linearly transform a vector of values with a certain associated range into values from another range.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
library(admiral)

transform_range(
  source = c(1, 4, 3, 6, 5),
  source_range = c(1, 5),
  target_range = c(0, 100)
)

```

Within ADaM programming, this is a common task, arising for instance when transforming questionnaire values into a standardized scale (e.g. 1-100). As such, we see this function being employed principally within calls to admiral::derive_param_computed() during the creation of datasets such as ADQS. You can read more about this topic within our [Questionnaire ADaMs vignette](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/questionnaires.html#transformed-items).

### Deprecation Strategy

::: {.callout-important}
We would like all users to be aware that a new deprecation strategy is being adopted by
the admiral team.  You can find the details linked here in our [Programming Strategy Guide](TBL)
:::

Previously, the team were going to keep "superseded" functions around indefinitely, i.e., a function that was replaced with a better function would be kept in admiral and maintained until universe-death.  Unfortunately, that places an enormous tech-debt on future maintainers.  It was decided that these "superseded" functions should in fact be deprecated and slowly removed from the code base.  Please check out our [Programming Strategy Guide](TBL) if you would like to better understand this process.

### Reminders on admiraldiscovery, cheatsheet, Find My Function, Working Groups

Work on {admiral} releases isn't just limited to new functions and deprecation. Indeed, for this release we have also updated the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/blob/main/inst/cheatsheet/admiral_cheatsheet.pdf) so that it is in line with the additions and changes for the new release. Additionally, we have made the [admiraldiscovery](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldiscovery/articles/reactable.html) (aka "Find my function") link more prominent on our website's navigation bar to increase the user traffic to our site.

<img src="admiraldiscovery.png" align="center" style="float:right" width="100%"/>

Also, from June up until now, we've had two working groups operating:

* The ADaM Implementation Guide working group, which has been diligently consulting the ADaM IG to identify any gaps within {admiral} functionality and/or documentation and creating issues to close the gaps.

* The Environments working group, which is currently reading select chapters from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) in order to refresh their understanding of environments before  potentially re-hashing the way these are treated in {admiral}.

If you have any ideas for new working groups of which you'd like to be a part, reach out to us - let's co-create {admiral} together!

### Recent Conferences

This post is also a great opportunity to showcase an publicize some of the fantastic outreach that members of the {admiral} community have done since our 1.1 release back in June. A couple of highlights include:

* At useR 2024 in Salzburg:
  * Edoardo Mancini and Stefan Thoma gave a presentation titled: *"{admiral} - the {dplyr} of the pharmaceutical industry?"* - [slides here](https://stefanthoma.github.io/useR_2024_admiral). 

* At R/Pharma 2024:

As you can see, {admiral} is spreading like wildfire in the pharma industry, and we encourage anyone within our community to spread the word and continue making these super presentations.

### What's we might be doing...for admiral 1.2 to 2.0 (title tbd)

* User input
* Remove `exprs()` 
* Speed up admiral for larger datasets
* json metadata for lab grading and questionnaires
*
