## ISCR 17th Annual Conference 2024

Indian Society for Clinical Research (ISCR), launched in June 2005, is a not-for-profit professional association of all stakeholders in clinical research. 

ISCR hosted its [17th Annual Conference 2024](https://conference.iscr.org/Default.aspx) at Hotel Novotel HICC, Hyderabad, INDIA on the theme **Transformations in Clinical Research For Better Patient Outcomes**, with Pre-Conference Workshops held on February 1, 2024 (Thursday) and two-day main Conference held on February 02 & 03, 2024 (Friday-Saturday), which were attended by over 800 delegates from academic institutions, ethics committees, bio-pharmaceutical industry, government, patient organizations and clinical research organizations.

## Session Recap

I had the privilege to present in front of 100+ delegates across the industry ranging from freshers to seasoned clinical professionals during ISCR 17th Annual Conference 2024 on the topic *Travese the PHARMAVERSE: ouR Insights* in the [Biostatistics and Statistical Programming|02-Feb-2024](https://conference.iscr.org/Agenda.aspx) track including many more interesting presentations highlighting their experience with R submissions using various open source technologies.

The session consisted of three presentations, namely:

  - A real world insight and navigation on bridging FDA submission using R by [Soumitra Kar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumitra-kar-007/) & [Mahendran Venkatachalam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahendran-venkatachalam-3aa7293b/)
  
  - Traverse the 'PHARMAVERSE' : ouR insights by [Pooja Kumari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pooja-kumari-581940b0/)
  
  - Package in CRAN : {admiralvaccine} by [Divya Kanagaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhivya-kanagaraj-149b68141/) and [Arjun R](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-r-2488b2208/)

It was inaugurated with great enthusiast and sharing insights on *Opportunities/Challenges of using different technologies like R in regulatory Submissions* by the session chair [Soumitra Kar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumitra-kar-007/). He along with his co-presenter [Mahendran Venkatachalam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahendran-venkatachalam-3aa7293b/) shared their experience of submitting first R-based Submission to FDA. The presentation was a perfect combination of inspiring storytelling, climax and thrill to address FDA review comments and releasing the blockbuster R submission by Novo-Nordisk creating history.  

This was followed by my presentation on *Travese the PHARMAVERSE: ouR Insights*, wherein I gave a brief introduction to PHARMAVERSE universe and how we operate. Many R enthusiasts are well versed with the evolution of [{admiral}](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/index.html) and its propensity to develop ADaMs. However, very few know about other packages such as [{metacore}](https://atorus-research.github.io/metacore/), [{metatools}](https://pharmaverse.github.io/metatools/), [{xportr}](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/) which are developed considering the regulatory agency guidelines and can aid the process of creating ADaM datasets proficiently. I took the opportunity to supercharge the process knowledge of creating submission ready ADaMs covering end-to-end process using these PHARMAVERSE packages along with some  to R submission success stories.

Next presentation was on [{admiralvaccine}](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralvaccine/), an extension package of [{admiral}](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/index.html) specific to vaccine studies under the PHARMAVERSE universe by [Divya Kanagaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhivya-kanagaraj-149b68141/) and [Arjun R](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-r-2488b2208/). They shared their exciting journey of developing the package since inception to final CRAN release from a developer's perspective. They also talked about the collaborative effort that went into its successful release. 

Overall session was concluded with an interactive Q&A wherein all the presenters and presentations were applauded by the audience as well as the Scientific Committee members. It was an enriching session to witness the growth of R programming leading to R submissions in Clinical Research & Pharmaceutical Industry.

## Key Takeaways 

The two-day conference was full of great learning and meeting esteemed Clinical Pharmaceutical Industry veterans/newbies discussing on trending topics such as *Optimizing Clinical Research through effective collaboration between Statisticians and Statistical Programmers*, *Can new technologies (AI/ML/IOT) a threat or blessing for Biostatisticians and Statistical Programmers?* through Panel discussions. 

The power of technology coupled with domain expertise can make us deliver quality results faster and serve the world with disease-free healthy life.

#### Why should we attend Conferences? 

  - Conferences are the best place to Connect, Collaborate and Communicate your thoughts with like-minded tribe. 
  
  - Biostatistics and Clinical Statistical Programming industry is growing and adopting open source technologies with great acceptance. As an individual we can contribute to communities like PHARMAVERSE to enhance our end-to-end process knowledge, develop programming skills and contribute to a revolutionary concept.
  
  - It gives you a platform to strengthen your presentation as well as self-branding skills.
