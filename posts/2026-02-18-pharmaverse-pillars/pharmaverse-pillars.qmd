## **Hi pharmaverse community!**

Big news from the council: after our late‑2025 strategy session, we’ve
formalized the pharmaverse pillars for 2026 — a friendly framework to
give clearer direction, focus effort, and help members plug in where
they can make the biggest impact.

To start, we thought about...

### **Why pillars?**

Pillars give us shared priorities without getting in the way of how we
collaborate. They make it easier to find people working on what you care
about, streamline decision‑making, and create clear channels for
contributions and ideas.

The **4 pillars** are:

Pillar Leads:

-   OS Software Solutions: Ross Farrugia, Orla Doyle

-   Community: Ashley Tarasiewicz, Alice Ehmann

-   PHUSE Working Group: Julia Gnatek, Nick Masel

-   Future Focus: Andre Couturier, Marcin Dubel

Each pillar will be led by a pair of council members where their role
will be to translate ideas into tangible actions or initiatives that are
valuable to our sustaining and growing our community.

If you have questions, ideas, or want to join a pillar effort, any of
the pillar leads above are your first point of contact - you can reach
any pillar lead via the [Slack pharmaverse
group](pharmaverse.slack.com)!

Over the next few months, look for blog posts relating to each pillar!

We’re excited to see how these pillars help everyone find meaningful
ways to contribute and collaborate. Thanks for being part of this
community — let’s build something useful, maintainable, and a little bit
delightful.
