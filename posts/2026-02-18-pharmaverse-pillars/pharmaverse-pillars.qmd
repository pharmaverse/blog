## **Hi pharmaverse community!**

Big news from the council: after our late‑2025 strategy session, we’ve formalised the pharmaverse pillars for 2026 — a friendly framework to give clearer direction, focus effort, and help members plug in where they can make the biggest impact.

To start, we thought about...

### **Why pillars?**

Pillars give us shared priorities without getting in the way of how we collaborate.
They make it easier to find people working on what you care about, streamline decision‑making, and create clear channels for contributions and ideas.

The **4 pillars** are:

Pillar Leads:

-   OS Software Solutions: Ross Farrugia, Orla Doyle

-   Community: Ashley Tarasiewicz, Alice Ehmann

-   PHUSE Working Group: Julia Gnatek, Nick Masel

-   Future Focus: Andre Couturier, Marcin Dubel

If you have questions, ideas, or want to join a pillar effort, any of the pillar leads above are your first point of contact - you can reach any pillar lead via the [Slack pharmaverse group](pharmaverse.slack.com)!

Over the next few months, look for blog posts relating to each pillar!

We’re excited to see how these pillars help everyone find meaningful ways to contribute and collaborate.
Thanks for being part of this community — let’s build something useful, maintainable, and a little bit delightful.
