On behalf of the pharmaverse council, we'd like to introduce you to Laura
Needleman – an active member of our community who has volunteered to support us
as a champion around DE&I. All of our efforts to this day have started from the
ground up with passionate people putting their hands up to make a difference for
our industry and patients all over the world. Therefore, when Laura identified a
challenge and stepped forward to help foster solutions, this resonated hugely
with us as a group that are looking to learn and evolve continually to make a
positive impact in our scope of open source. Here's some further introduction
and context from Laura in her own words...

"Over the summer, I approached the pharmaverse council ready to join forces with
a Diversity Champion proposal in hand. As I walked the council through my
proposal and thoughts, I believe they saw my passion for equal access and
representation was burning bright! I was ready to hit the ground running to
help the community members feel **represented** and **heard** within
pharmaverse.

I plan to work with the council to not only suggest ways to increase more
diversity, equity, and inclusion at the top (within the council) and within the
community but also as an autistic brain ready to pick apart systems and ask the
questions others might not be asking. If there is one thing autistics hit out
of the park... it's disrupting groupthink. Do I hear a record scratch every time
I open my mouth and say something? ...yes ...yes I do...

Jokes aside, one thing that drew my attention to pharmaverse and why I wanted to
give my time to further DE&I is because I could see the large-scale movement
that was happening from the energy the pharmaverse platform was creating. The
increase in R collaboration over the past 4 years in our industry is noticeable
and palpable even and I believe that movement is in part because of the systems
and communities built off of the pharmaverse foundation. As an R user myself,
and as someone in our biometrics clinical reporting community of programmers and
statisticians, it's a grassroots type space where people are coming with their
ideas on how to make it better and it grows year by year. Even when that
feedback is uncomfortable to hear, such as gender disparity in the council,
response and action is taken and that is something I can back and believe in.

As far as my professional background in this space, currently I am the US Policy
Lead for Astrazeneca's Neurodiversity Employee Resource Group, TH!NK, which is a
role designed to advocate for neurodivergent employees around accommodations and
team perceptions as well as contribute to US Policies from a neurodivergent
perspective. I am also an autistic public advocate in our space of biometrics
clinical trials where I openly share my experiences in our industry as an
autistic woman. I have presented topics of Neurodiversity at both PharmaSUG and
PHUSE and have an active voice on LinkedIn. In addition, in 2022, I was awarded
Cytel's CEO award for furthering their DE&I mission.

DE&I work is an intentional process that is done consciously and continuously.
My presence within the pharmaverse council is a relationship and not a solution
in it of itself. I come to the council as an individual advisor and thus my
presence within the council does not represent Astrazeneca joining the council.
Please reach out to me if you'd like to chat about DE&I at pharmaverse, in
general or on a specific concern! I am listening and I'll work to elevate voices
that need it. Remember, I'm not perfect, I also have a disability, and I am here
to do volunteer DE&I work at no cost.

Feel free to reach out via email at any time – laura.needleman@astrazeneca.com
or connect and reach out to me on LinkedIn!"
