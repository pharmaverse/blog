## Harnessing HPC for Drug Development

In pharmaceutical research, high-performance computing (HPC) plays a pivotal 
role in driving advancements in drug discovery and development. From analyzing
vast genomic datasets to simulating drug interactions across diverse
populations, HPC enables researchers to tackle complex computational tasks at
high speeds. As pharmaceutical research becomes increasingly data-driven, the
need for powerful computational tools has grown, allowing for more accurate
predictions, faster testing, and more efficient processes. However, with the
growing complexity and scale of these computations, ensuring reproducibility
of results becomes a significant challenge.

In this blog post, we will explore common reproducibility challenges in drug
development and simulations, using the 
[`{mirai}`](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/) package as a backend solution to 
manage parallelization.

## The Problem: Reproducibility in Parallel Processing

Imagine a research team working on a cutting-edge drug development project. To
process and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently, they leverage parallel
processing, distributing tasks across multiple processors. This approach
significantly accelerates their work, enabling them to handle large datasets and
complex computations in a fraction of the time.

However, the team soon encounters an issue. Each time they rerun the same
processing tasks with identical input parameters, the results differ slightly.
This raises a major concern: *the results are not reproducible.* In industries 
like pharmaceuticals, where accuracy and consistency are critical,
reproducibility is not just important—it's a regulatory requirement.

For example, in large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, small differences can arise
not only from changes in execution order across processors but also from
inconsistencies between workers or difficulties in maintaining synchronized
random number generation (RNG) streams. Furthermore, the more complex the
environment—with multiple components such as distributed workers, different
hardware, or varying system configurations—the harder it becomes to reprovision
the exact same environment and repeat the computations exactly. As these
variations accumulate, ensuring consistent and reproducible results becomes
a significant challenge in data-driven research.

### Tracking Operations in Parallel Computing

Let’s explore a simple scenario where parallelization creates confusion in 
tracking operations due to the asynchronous nature of task execution and
logging. For this, we will also use the 
[`{tidylog}`](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) package, which tracks and logs
`{dplyr}` operations, providing insight into how the computations are executed
across multiple workers. 

We'll create our workflow in a script and run it using the `{logrx}` package 
from Pharmaverse. The workflow will be written as an expression using 
`base::substitute()`, which will help generate the complete script. In our 
example, we'll start four daemons. A daemon is a background process that runs in
the background continuously and handles specific computing tasks.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
mirai_workflow <- substitute({
  library("mirai")
  library("dplyr")
  
  log_file <- tempfile()
  
  # start parallel workers
  mirai::daemons(4)
  
  # load libraries on each worker and set up logging to a file
  mirai::everywhere(
    {
      library("dplyr")
      library("tidylog")
  
      # Define function to log messages to the log file
      log_to_file <- \(txt) cat(txt, file = log_file, sep = "\n", append = TRUE)
      options("tidylog.display" = list(message, log_to_file))
    },
    log_file = log_file
  )
  
  # perform computations in parallel
  m <- mirai_map(letters[1:5], \(x) {
    mutate(tibble(.rows = 1), "{x}" := sample(1:100, 1))
  })
  
  # collect results
  result <- m[] |> bind_cols()
  
  mirai::daemons(0)
  
  print(
    list(
      logs = readLines(log_file),
      result = result
    )
  )
})
```

In the above code chunk, we set up a parallel processing environment using the
`{mirai}` package. The function `mirai_map()` is used to apply a mutating
function in parallel to a tibble for each element of `letters`, logging the
operations to a file using the `{tidylog}` package. However, while we can log
each operation as it happens, due to the parallel nature of `{mirai}`, the 
logging does not occur in a controlled or sequential order. *Each daemon
executes its task independently, and the order of logging in the file will
depend on the completion times of these parallel processes rather than the
intended flow of operations.*

> Parallel computations can obscure the traceability of operations

This lack of control can lead to a situation where the log entries do not
reflect the actual sequence in which the `{dplyr}` commands were expected to be
processed. Although the operations themselves are carried out correctly, the
asynchronous logging may create challenges in *tracing* and *debugging* the
process, as entries in the log file could appear out of order, giving an
incomplete or misleading representation of the task flow.

Let's first save the code to an R script called `mirai_workflow.R`. This step
helps ensure that the execution can be properly tracked and documented:

```{r}
mirai_workflow |>
  deparse() |>
  writeLines("mirai_workflow.R")
```

Next, we execute the script using `logrx::axecute()`, which not only runs the
workflow but also logs key metadata and outputs for enhanced traceability and
reproducibility:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
logrx::axecute("mirai_workflow.R", to_report = "result")
```

```{r cache_exec, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#run this to refresh cache and get a non ordered log file
res_to_cache <- source("mirai_workflow.R")
saveRDS(res_to_cache$value, "cache_execution.rds")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
readRDS("cache_execution.rds")
```

Upon examining the log file generated, you'll notice that the entries are not in
the same order as the commands were dispatched. This illustrates the inherent 
difficulty in maintaining a consistent logging sequence for parallel tasks, 
especially since the timing of each process completion and log recording is 
unpredictable.

Additionally, it is worth noting that `logrx` does not capture the logging 
performed by `{tidylog}` during the execution of tasks on `{mirai}` daemons.
This is because the daemons run as independent R processes, and the logging
messages are not propagated back to the parent process in a straightforward
manner. As described in `{mirai}`'s documentation, daemons are responsible for
handling tasks asynchronously, and messages logged within these processes do not
automatically integrate into the parent session. Therefore, the only way to
access `{tidylog}` messages is indirectly, by reading the dedicated log file
(`log.txt`) that each worker writes to during execution.

### Task Dispatching and RNG Management

By default, `{mirai}` uses an advanced dispatcher to manage task distribution
efficiently, scheduling tasks in a First-In-First-Out manner and leveraging
[`{nanonext}`](https://shikokuchuo.net/nanonext/) primitives for zero-latency,
resource-free task management. However, its asynchronous execution can hinder
reproducibility, especially with random number generation (RNG) or tasks needing
strict order.

To enhance reproducibility, `{mirai}` allows disabling the dispatcher which 
usually decides the order in which tasks are run. Instead, it connects directly
to the workers one by one in a simple order
(see [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling)). While 
less efficient, this approach provides greater control over task execution and 
is better suited for ensuring reproducibility by initializing 
[L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG streams](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/opre.47.1.159).

In the following example, we simulate drug efficacy across different patient
cohorts using parallel processing with the `{mirai}` package. We define three
cohorts, each with a different mean drug effect and standard deviation, and 
initialize four daemons to handle the computations. 

```{r}
library(mirai)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

# Parameters for the simulation
cohorts <- tribble(
  ~patient_count, ~mean_effect, ~sd_effect,
  1000,           0.7,          0.1,
  1000,           0.65,         0.15,
  1000,           0.75,         0.05
)

# Start daemons with consistent RNG streams
x <- mirai::daemons(4, dispatcher = FALSE, seed = 123)

# Parallel simulation for each row of the cohorts table
m <- mirai::mirai_map(cohorts, \(patient_count, mean_effect, sd_effect) {
  dplyr::tibble(
    patient_id = 1:patient_count,
    efficacy = rnorm(patient_count, mean = mean_effect, sd = sd_effect)
  )
})

results <- m[] |> bind_rows()

x <- mirai::daemons(0, dispatcher = FALSE)

results %>%
  group_by(patient_id) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_efficacy = mean(efficacy),
    sd_efficacy = sd(efficacy)
  )
```

We used `tribble()` to define the simulation parameters and 
initialize 4 daemons with `dispatcher = FALSE` and a fixed seed to ensure 
consistent random number generation across tasks. The `mirai_map()` function
parallelizes the drug efficacy simulation, and the results are combined using 
`bind_rows()` for further analysis. 

Disabling the dispatcher gives more control over task execution, ensuring 
reproducibility. If you repeat the computation you
will notice that it generates consistent results. However, this approach comes 
at a cost. Disabling the dispatcher may lead to inefficient resource utilization
when tasks are unevenly distributed, as some daemons may remain idle. While 
reproducibility is prioritized, we sacrifice some performance, especially 
when handling tasks with varying workloads.

Reproducibility becomes trickier when using parallelization frameworks like 
`{parallelMap}`, `{doFuture}`, and `{future}`, as each handles random number 
generation (RNG) differently. While `set.seed()` works for sequential tasks, 
parallel tasks need careful management of RNG streams, often using specific 
methods like "L’Ecuyer-CMRG" or functions like `clusterSetRNGStream()` to keep 
results consistent. Each framework has its own approach, so it's important to 
understand how each one manages RNG to ensure reproducibility.

Even without random numbers, simple tasks—like adding floating-point numbers—can
give different results in parallel processing. This happens because 
floating-point numbers aren’t exactly represented, and the order of operations 
can affect the outcome. In parallel environments, where tasks finish in 
different orders, these small differences can add up, making it harder to 
reproduce results in large computations.

## Closing Thoughts 

While we've explored the basics of reproducibility in parallel computing with 
simple examples, the challenges extend beyond random number generation. Issues 
such as *process synchronization*, using tools like lock files (see for example 
[`{filelock}`](https://r-lib.github.io/filelock/)), become critical
in multi-process environments. *Floating-point arithmetic* adds complexity, 
particularly when distributed across heterogeneous systems with varying
architectures and precision. *Managing dependencies* also becomes more 
intricate as tasks grow in complexity, and ensuring *error recovery* in a 
controlled manner is vital to avoid crashes or inconsistent results in 
large-scale operations.

Powerful tools like [`{targets}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and 
[`{crew}`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) can help tackle these advanced 
challenges. `{targets}` is a workflow orchestration tool that manages 
dependencies, automates reproducible pipelines, and ensures consistent results
across runs. Meanwhile, `{crew}` extends this by efficiently managing 
distributed computing tasks, allowing for seamless scaling, load balancing, 
and error handling across local processes or cloud environments. Together, these 
tools simplify the execution of complex high-performance computing (HPC) 
workflows, providing flexibility and robustness for scaling computations while 
trying for maintaining control and reproducibility.

This blog post has hopefully increased your intuition about the challenges that 
may arise when incorporating HPC into your work. By understanding these 
complexities, you’ll be better positioned to make informed decisions about the 
trade-offs—such as balancing performance and reproducibility — that are most
relevant to your specific case. As your computations scale, finding the right
balance between efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility will be crucial for 
the success of your projects.
