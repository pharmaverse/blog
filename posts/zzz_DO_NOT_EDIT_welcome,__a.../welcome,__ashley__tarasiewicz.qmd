Hello pharmaverse community! 

I’m thrilled to announce that Ashley Tarasiewicz will be taking over the Atorus seat from me on the Pharmaverse council. 

Ashley has been a contributor to the pharmaverse since the early days of its inception, contributing to packages such as {Tplyr}, {pharmaRTF}, and {metacore}. One of Ashley’s biggest strengths is being a voice of the user, calling on her history working through clinical reporting and submissions. In the time since Ashley joined Atorus, she built Atorus Academy to help with the up-skilling of SAS programmers to learn R. Ashley has now transitioned to the product owner OpenVal, a validated R distribution. 

It was a no-brainer for me to have Ashley take over my council seat. For me personally, Ashley is an individual that I’ve leaned on since the very beginning of my career. As a sounding board and trusted confidant, having her at Atorus has been critical to our success. As such, I’m confident that her voice in the pharmaverse council will continue to help steer the community and drive progress for the industry overall.

Welcome, Ashley!
