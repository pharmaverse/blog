Hello, Phriends!

In case you missed it, earlier this year, PHUSE and pharmaverse strengthened
their initial relationship (_established 2023_) by bringing pharmaverse
within the PHUSE community as the 9th active Working Group. At the moment, we are
exploring what WG projects you might begin to see under the WG umbrella - and if
you have ideas, you can email us at
<a href="mailto:pharmaverse.council@phuse.global">pharmaverse.council@phuse.global</a>.

**You may be asking - why this move and why now?**

Well, pharmaverse began as (and still is) a set of "_curated open source R packages
for clinical reporting usage in pharma_". And, pharmaverse has grown into a fantastic
community of professionals passionate about clinical research, clinical data, and
open source development (often using R). Now, as a PHUSE Working Group, we can
expand beyond the initial definition of "_R packages for clinical data_" and find
new and exciting ways to impact our growing community (and the PHUSE community).

For example – check out
[this blog post](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2025-06-30_did_my_eyes.../did_my_eyes_just_see__python_in_the_pharmaverse.html)
from Ross Farrugia on a foray into python.

In addition, we see three key benefits to the mission of pharmaverse:

1. Since inception, we've always recognized the inherent risk in relying on
volunteer and community driven effort to build and maintain solutions that global
companies embed in their production systems. Initially, we valued the agility we
enjoyed from being independent of oversight by another organization. However, the
backing of PHUSE, its Working Groups, and its robust community assure us of the
sustainability of any pharmaverse package for the longer term. PHUSE Working Groups
have a proven track record of delivering high quality and impactful resources for
the Clinical Data Science community to leverage. And, now pharmaverse will benefit
even more from what PHUSE has to offer.
1. As a community, we now have the
[PHUSE Code of Conduct](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Communications/Forms/PHUSE+Code+of+Conduct+-+V3+December+2024.pdf)
that we can rely on to uphold our values that we exhibit and expect from others.
1. We retain our autonomy for decision making for pharmaverse strategy and
direction – and the stronger connection to the PHUSE Community and leadership
will help us to be more effective in this regard.

Watch this space and get involved where you can! We've been astounded at what
this community has delivered in 4 short years - and we can't wait to see what's
next!
