📢[`admiralpeds 0.1`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralpeds/index.html) is __coming soon__ [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) !

`{admiralpeds} is a pediatrics extension package for ADaM in R Asset Library `{admiral}`. Its first release is planned by July 2024.

# Collaboration

7 companies (Roche, Pfizer, Amgen, BMS, J&J, Novartis, and Cytel) and David Freedman, a passionate consultant retired from CDC, are working together to create this extension 🤝.

# Purpose

The purpose of this new extension is to provide a complementary (to `{admiral}`) toolbox that enables users to develop specifics ADaMs datasets for pediatric clinical trials.
Initially the package will focus on child growth/development charts: [WHO and CDC growth charts](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm), among infants and children ages birth to 19 years included. 

# New Features

We are starting with 2 new functions : 

* `admiral::derive_params_growth_age()`
* `admiral::derive_params_growth_height()`

The first function, `derive_params_growth_age()` is based on the current age of the patients, while the second one, `derive_params_growth_height()` depends on the height or length of the patients. The two functions are flexible enough to choose your own metadata. This could either be be company dependent, or the pre-defined ones based on WHO and CDC charts. You can also choose the desired parameters (e.g. "BMI", "HEIGHT", "WEIGHT", "HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE").

# Waiting for the release

As for all packages, an entire month will be used for package testing before the release.
More technical details about `{admiralpeds}` to come at that time, so __stay tuned__ 👀! 

# What else?

We also are excited to announce that some very early preparations have started on the next package extension joining our family - which will primarily be a collaboration between Roche and Novo Nordisk focused initially on endpoints in clinical trials for obesity. The package name is still to be decided, with the frontrunner being {admiralmetabolic}. Watch this space for more news!
