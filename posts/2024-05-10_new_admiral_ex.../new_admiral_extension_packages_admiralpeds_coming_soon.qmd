<!--------------- typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2024-05-10_new_admiral_ex..."
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
üì¢[`admiralpeds 0.1`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralpeds/index.html) is __coming soon__ [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) !

Pediatrics extension package for ADaM in R Asset Library `{admiral}` : its first release is planned by July 2024.

# Collaboration

7 companies (Roche, Pfizer, Amgen, BMS, J&J, Novartis, and Cytel) and David Freedman, a passionate consultant retired from CDC, are working together to create this extension ü§ù.

# Purpose

The purpose of this new extension is to provide a complementary (to `{admiral}`) toolbox that enables users to develop specifics ADaMs datasets for pediatric clinical trials.
Initially the package will focus on child growth/development charts: [WHO and CDC growth charts](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm), among infants and children ages birth to 19 years included. 

# New Features

We are starting with 2 new functions : 

* derive_params_growth_age()
* derive_params_growth_height()

The first function `derive_params_growth_age()` is based on the current age of the patients, while the second one `derive_params_growth_height()` depends on the height or length of the patients. The two functions are flexible enough to chose your own metadata which could be company dependent or the pre-defined ones based on WHO and CDC charts, and to chose the wanted parameters (e.g. "BMI", "HEIGHT", "WEIGHT", "HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE").

# Waiting for the release

As for all packages, an entire month will be used for package testing before the release.
More technical details about `{admiralpeds}` to come at that time, so __stay tuned__ üëÄ ! 

# What else ?

We also are excited to announce that some very early preparations have started on the next package extension joining our family - which will be a collaboration between Roche and Novo Nordisk (any maybe others) focused initially on endpoints in clinical trials for obesity. Name still to be decided - possibly {admiralmetabolic} - watch this space for more news!


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
