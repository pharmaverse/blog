# admiral 1.4 is here!

## What is in this release?

This release brings the following:

* Experimental functions `derive_var_nfrlt()` and `convert_xxtpt_to_hours()` to simplify time point and visit derivations. 
* Integration of NCI-CTCAE version 6.0 lab grading criteria for both SI and US units, with all grading metadata now maintained in a more readable JSON format for improved consistency and maintainability. 
* Experimental ADAB template script to aid in creating Anti-drug Antibody Analysis Datasets, while several existing parameter derivation functions have been updated for greater robustness. 
* Notable breaking change involves `derive_var_atoxgr_dir()`, where the abnormal_indicator argument is replaced by low_indicator and high_indicator to support the updated CTCAE v6.0 criteria
* `derive_var_merged_summary()` has been renamed to `derive_vars _merged_summary()` to align with programming conventions. 
* Improvement of documentation, including the addition of an "Ask AI" widget to assist users.

Let's discuss!!
