We are pleased to announce the release of **{pharmaversesdtm} 1.4.0** 🎉  
This release expands the breadth of SDTM test data available in the package, with a particular focus on **neurology and oncology**, alongside several targeted enhancements and fixes.

## ✨ What’s New in 1.4.0

### 🧠 New neurological SDTM test datasets

Version 1.4.0 introduces a set of **neurology-focused SDTM test datasets**, extending the package coverage of therapeutic areas:

- `dm_neuro` - demographic data for neurological studies  
- `nv_neuro` - neurological findings  
- `suppnv_neuro` - supplemental qualifiers for neurological findings  
- `ag_neuro` - associated groups for neurological domains  
- `lb_neuro` - neurological laboratory test data  

These datasets are intended to support development, testing, and examples for neurology-specific workflows.

### 📊 New and updated variables

Several existing datasets have been enhanced:

- **`VISITDY`** has been added to the `pc` domain to support consistent visit day derivations.
- **`BRTHDTC`** has been added to both `dm` and `dm_metabolic`, improving demographic completeness.
- The `qs_ophtha` dataset now uses an updated `QSTESTCD` aligned with CDISC terminology and has been simplified for easier use in examples.

### 🧬 Oncology data improvements

This release also includes important updates for oncology use cases:

- Corrections to `rs_onco_pcwg3`, addressing misclassified progression indicators and response records.
- A new oncology biomarker dataset, **`lb_onco_pcwg3`**, providing PSA measurements aligned with PCWG criteria.

### 🧠 Neurological dataset enhancements

Neurological laboratory data includes biomarkers Alpha Synuclein Seed Amplification Assay (CSF),  Lumipulse G pTau217, Lumipulse G β-Amyloid 1-42, and the ratio of pTau217 and β-Amyloid 1-42.

### 📚 Documentation and developer updates

To help you explore datasets by therapeutic area, the **reference pages** have been reorganized to group datasets under meaningful categories such as metabolic, neurological, and oncology. This makes navigation easier for researchers and developers alike.
