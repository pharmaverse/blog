Hi pharmaverse community,

On behalf of the council we wanted to update you on the latest council member
2-yearly renewals.

Firstly, we’d like to thank Ari Siggaard Knoph who has stepped back from his
Novo Nordisk council representative role as of Jan 2025. Ari brought so much
to the pharmaverse council in his 2 years with us, including amazing technical
work to make our site homepage as visually appealing as it is today with our
hexwall and contributor network graph, plus impactful presentations at PHUSE
and beyond. He showed great passion for open source and as a user himself of
many of the pharmaverse packages, he always kept us true to what people working
in clinical reporting care most about.

With this, we are delighted to welcome Julia Gnatek as Ari’s replacement to
represent Novo Nordisk on the council. Julia has been a statistical programmer
at Novo Nordisk for over 5 years. She began her career as a statistical programmer
and is now a statistical programming project lead within the Rare Disease area.
As an R, SAS, and Python user, Julia is dedicated to leveraging her programming
skills to drive innovation within the organization. Outside of work, she enjoys
participating in data science communities and attending industry conferences to
stay updated with the latest trends and advancements.

Please join us in thanking Ari for his contributions and welcoming Julia!

We also have several other council members terms due to expire as of March 2025,
and we’re happy to confirm that Michael Rimler, Mike Stackhouse, Sumesh
Kalappurakal and Ross Farrugia have all agreed to renew council membership
for another 2 years. As the 4 founding members of pharmaverse we all felt there
was still so much more impact this initiative can achieve, and we wanted to
continue to commit our time to helping open source prosper for the good of all
patients across the world.
