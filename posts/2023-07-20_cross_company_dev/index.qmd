# Introduction:

In the fast-paced world of pharmaceutical research and development, the need for efficient and standardized data management solutions has never been more crucial. 
This blog post delves into the journey of an ambitious team working towards an end-to-end solution in R, particularly focusing on the transformation from SDTM to ADaM, while advocating for collaborative open-source development across companies. 
We will explore the challenges we faced, the strategies we employed, and the significant impact this approach has had on both Roche and the industry as a whole.

## Who am I:
I joined Roche as an intern in November 2022, and since April, I have become a permanent member of the Admiral team, dedicating 20% of my time to this project.

# Problem to be solved:
The lack of a comprehensive, standardized solution in R for end-to-end clinical data analysis presented a significant challenge in the industry. Many companies developed their own custom solutions, resulting in a fragmented landscape. Even individuals proficient in SAS had to relearn company-specific solutions, leading to inefficiencies and delays. The team recognized the need for an end-to-end framework. The admiral package covers the transformation from SDTM to ADaM, addressing a specific part of this pipeline.

# Proposed Solution:
Enter Admiral! Admiral is not a Roche product, but a collaborative effort that aims to create an open-source package to solve the data standards challenge. The vision was to develop a solution that would be widely accessible, fostering collaboration and standardization across the pharmaceutical industry.

# Challenges at Startup:
Launching a collaborative open-source project is no small feat. The team faced the task of convincing higher-ups and peers about the value and relevance of the project. By demonstrating the real problem that needed solving, they managed to gain support from key stakeholders. Furthermore, they sought to expand their influence beyond Roche and reached out to other companies, forming a team consisting of Thomas Neitmann from Roche and Marco Rimmler from GSK, right from the start.

# Strategies:
To ensure success, the team adopted several key strategies. Acting quickly was imperative, as they open-sourced the project at an early stage and communicated their intentions widely. By involving multiple companies, they fostered a collaborative community, where users could actively participate in the development process, providing feedback and creating issues. The team also embraced a modular approach, developing a core package alongside therapeutic area-specific packages and internal company packages. This modularity was complemented by consistent interfaces and design guidelines across all packages, facilitated by a developer's guide and continuous integration and continuous deployment (CICD). Furthermore, they created templates for common and more complex tasks, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

# Impact for Roche:
For Roche, the adoption of the Admiral project yielded remarkable benefits. Instead of relying on just two developers, they gained the power of a full team consisting of ten developers. This amplified workforce not only accelerated progress but also provided Roche with a seat at the table. By collaborating with other companies, Roche ensured that they were part of the conversation, driving industry-wide standards.

# Attractive Workplace:
Embracing open-source development and utilizing R as a primary tool for data management also made Roche an attractive workplace for talented individuals. Open-source development inherently promotes transparency and ethics, appealing to those seeking a more collaborative and inclusive work environment. The collaboration across companies dissolved traditional hierarchies, encouraging autonomous work and empowering individuals to choose the issues they wished to tackle. Additionally, this approach expanded networks and facilitated knowledge transfer, making talent more adaptable and valuable across various positions.

# Conclusion:
The benefits of developing open-source packages across companies, as exemplified by the Admiral project, are truly transformative. By pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise, companies in the pharmaceutical industry can overcome the challenges of data management and foster a culture of collaboration and standardization. The impact extends beyond immediate gains in efficiency and productivity; it attracts new hires, encourages transparency, and cultivates a vibrant community of professionals dedicated to advancing pharmaceutical research and development. The Admiral project serves as a testament to the power of collaborative open-source development and the potential it holds for the future of the industry.
