**Story**

Since the Australian Aboriginal, the earliest peoples recorded to have inhabited the Earth and who have been in Australia for at least 65,000 to 80,000 years ([Encyclop√¶dia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-Aboriginal)), human beings live in group.
Whether to protect yourself, increase your life expectancy or simply share tasks.

For most aspects of life, it doesn't make sense to think, act or work alone for two main reasons:

1.  You will spend more energy and time;

2.  Someone else may be facing (or have faced) the same situation.

The English poet John Donne used to say *"No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;"*.
I can't disagree with him.
And I dare say that Michael Rimler (GSK), Mike Stackhouse (Atorus), Ross Farrugia (Roche), and Sumesh Kalappurakal (Janssen) agree with me.
They are the founders of [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/), members of its Council and kindly shared their memories of how independent companies, in mid-2020, worked together in the creation of a set of packages developed to support the clinical reporting pipeline.

If you are not familiar with this pipeline, you just need to know that, in a nutshell, pharmaceutical companies must follow a bunch of standardized procedures and formats when submitting clinical results to Health Authorities.
Remember that: **different** companies seeking the **same** standards of outputs.

And paraphrasing Ross presentation in [R/PHARMA 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APMDOS4v9Hk), I'd like also to point out that, thinking of the development of a new drug, we are talking about a "post-competitive" scenario, where the drug was already discovered and we "only" must produce and deliver results.
