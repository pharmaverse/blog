**Story**

Since the earliest peoples recorded to have inhabited the Earth, like the Australian Aboriginal peoples (who have been in Australia for at least 65,000 to 80,000 years, according to [Encyclop√¶dia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-Aboriginal)), human beings live in group.
Whether to protect yourself, increase your life expectancy or simply share tasks.

John Donne used to say *"No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;"*.
