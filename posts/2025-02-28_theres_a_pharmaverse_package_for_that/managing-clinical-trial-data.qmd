Working with clinical trial data is no small task. It needs to be precise, compliant, and efficient. Traditionally, this meant using proprietary tools and working within siloed systems, which often made the process more complicated and expensive than necessary. But we think there’s a better way.

The [**pharmaverse**](https://pharmaverse.org/) is an open-source ecosystem of R packages built specifically for clinical trials. These tools integrate seamlessly with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), making data management more flexible, efficient, and transparent.

Whether you’re collecting, validating, analyzing, or preparing data for regulatory submission, there’s a pharmaverse package designed to support your workflow and help you work smarter.

This post covers:

-   Key stages of clinical trials and the R packages that support them

-   Creating ADSL datasets and essential programming steps

-   Key players in pharmaverse and whether you need all packages

-   How pharmaverse compares to Tidyverse and how to learn it

By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how pharmaverse supports clinical trial operations and how to apply these tools in your work.

## Key Stages of Clinical Reporting

Managing clinical trial data involves multiple stages, each with its own challenges. **Pharmaverse** provides a range of R packages that support different parts of the process, sometimes even offering multiple options for the same task. This flexibility allows organizations to choose the best tools for their specific needs rather than sticking to a one-size-fits-all approach.

A **metadata-driven approach** helps ensure that clinical trial data is consistently structured and aligned with regulatory standards. The typical process follows this sequence:

**Metadata** ➝ **OAK** ➝ **Admiral** ➝ **Define.xml** ➝ **TLGs** ➝ **Submissions**

Some examples of **pharmaverse** packages that support clinical reporting include:

-   {diffdf} – Tracking differences in datasets.
-   {metatools} – Metadata management and transformation.
-   {sdtm.oak} – The primary **pharmaverse** package for SDTM dataset creation.
-   {datacutr} - Performing data cuts.
-   {admiral} – Standardized data derivations.
-   {metacore} – Metadata-driven structures.
-   The **pharmaverse** provides multiple table-making packages, such as {chevron} (which builds on {rtables}), {Tplyr}, {pharmaRTF}, {gtsummary}, {cards}, {tfrmt}, and {tidytlg}. More tools are listed on the [TLGs page](https://pharmaverse.org/e2eclinical/tlg/).
-   {xportr} – CDISC-compliant dataset export.
-   {pkglite} – Package management and tracking.
-   {metacore} and {metatools} – For standardized metadata structures and validation.
-   {logrx} - For logging R scripts.

Pharmaverse packages are built on top of **[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)** tools and integrate seamlessly with packages like {dplyr} for data manipulation and {ggplot2} for visualization.

> **Note:** This post highlights some key **pharmaverse** packages relevant to clinical reporting. For a full and up-to-date list, visit the [Pharmaverse website](https://pharmaverse.org/). If there's a package we missed that should be included, let us know, and we’d be happy to update this post.

By using these tools, organizations can optimize their data pipeline, ensuring clinical data is well-structured and ready for regulatory submission with ease.

## **Example: Creating ADSL**

Building an ADSL dataset involves several key steps, from reading in data to deriving treatment variables and population flags. While these steps apply regardless of the tools used, **pharmaverse packages like {admiral} simplify the process** with functions designed for CDISC-compliant datasets.

This example is based on the [ADSL template](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/admiral/vignettes/adsl.html), which provides a structured approach to creating an ADSL dataset.

#### **Step 1: Read in Data**

To begin, clinical trial datasets such as **DM, EX, DS, AE, and LB** are loaded. The {pharmaversesdtm} package provides sample CDISC SDTM datasets:

``` {R, eval = TRUE}
library(admiral)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(pharmaversesdtm)
library(stringr)

# Load sample data
data("dm", package = "pharmaversesdtm")
data("ex", package = "pharmaversesdtm")
data("ds", package = "pharmaversesdtm")
```

ADSL is typically **built from the DM dataset**, removing unnecessary columns and adding treatment variables in one step:

``` {R, eval = TRUE}
adsl <- dm %>%
  select(-DOMAIN) %>%
  mutate(
    TRT01P = ARM,
    TRT01A = ACTARM
  )
```

#### **Step 2: Derive Treatment Variables**

Using {admiral}, we extract and standardize treatment dates from the EX dataset:

``` {R, eval = TRUE}
ex_ext <- ex %>%
  filter(!is.na(USUBJID)) %>%
  derive_vars_dt(
    dtc = EXSTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "EXST"
  ) %>%
  derive_vars_dt(
    dtc = EXENDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "EXEN"
  )
```

Then merge these dates into ADSL:

``` {R, eval = TRUE}
adsl <- adsl %>%
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = ex_ext,
    filter_add = (EXDOSE > 0 |
      (EXDOSE == 0 &
        str_detect(EXTRT, "PLACEBO"))) & !is.na(EXSTDT),
    new_vars = exprs(TRTSDT = EXSTDT),
    order = exprs(EXSTDT, EXSEQ),
    mode = "first",
    by_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID)
  ) %>%
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = ex_ext,
    filter_add = (EXDOSE > 0 |
      (EXDOSE == 0 &
        str_detect(EXTRT, "PLACEBO"))) & !is.na(EXENDT),
    new_vars = exprs(TRTEDT = EXENDT),
    order = exprs(EXENDT, EXSEQ),
    mode = "last",
    by_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID)
  )
```

#### **Step 3: Derive End of Study (EOS) Status**

The disposition dataset (DS) is used to determine when a patient exited the study:

``` {R, eval = TRUE}
ds_ext <- ds %>%
  filter(!is.na(DSSTDTC)) %>%
  derive_vars_dt(
    dtc = DSSTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "DSST"
  )

adsl <- adsl %>%
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = ds_ext,
    by_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID),
    new_vars = exprs(EOSDT = DSSTDT),
    filter_add = DSCAT == "DISPOSITION EVENT" & DSDECOD != "SCREEN FAILURE"
  )
```

#### **Step 4: Assign Population Flags**

For safety population (`SAFFL`), we check if the patient received a treatment dose:

``` {R, eval = TRUE}
adsl <- adsl %>%
  derive_var_merged_exist_flag(
    dataset_add = ex,
    by_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID),
    new_var = SAFFL,
    condition = EXDOSE > 0 | str_detect(EXTRT, "PLACEBO")
  )
```

#### **Step 5: Generate and Save Results**

Finally, we save the dataset CSV and can view some of its columns:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Save to a CSV file
write.csv(adsl, "adsl_output.csv", row.names = FALSE)

adsl
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
adsl %>%
  dataset_vignette(
    display_vars = exprs(USUBJID, TRT01P, TRT01A, TRTSDT, TRTEDT, SAFFL)
  )
```

#### **More Details on ADSL Creation**

This is just a **high-level example**; the full process includes deriving death variables, grouping populations, and applying labels. For a deeper dive, check out the [ADSL Implementation Guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/admiral/vignettes/adsl.html).
