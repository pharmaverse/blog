The second half of 2025 brings us once again to an exciting {admiral} release! Read through this blog post to learn more what is available in {admiral} 1.3.

## Headline update: documentation that gets you

Our crowning update this release cycle is...

**Documentation updates!**

Hmmm, doesn't sound fancy enough? What about...

<span style="font-size: 2em;
              background: linear-gradient(to right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet);
              -webkit-background-clip: text;
              -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">
Documentation updates!!
</span>

Still not that interesting? Well, let us change your mind with an example. Here's what the examples section of the reference page for admiral::derive_extreme_records() looked like in {admiral} 1.2:

<img src="derive_extreme_records_before.png" align="center" style="float:right" width="100%"/>

And here's what it looks like in {admiral} 1.3:

<img src="derive_extreme_records_after.png" align="center" style="float:right" width="100%"/>

That's right! Some of our reference examples have now been enhanced such that:

- Each example has a title, which is also shown in the table of contents, and a description explaining what is happening.
- The examples are often building up in complexity, starting from a simple application of the function in a toy case and building up to more structured use-cases.
- The examples for this function now cover __all__ the arguments of the function.

As usual, you can access these reference examples from our [documentation website](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/dev/reference/) or alternatively directly from RStudio's own Help pane by typing `?function_name` in the console.

For this first iteration, we have targeted some of the most complex, flexible and important functions within {admiral}. The functions which have received this enhanced example treatment are:

- admiral::derive_extreme_records()
- admiral::derive_param_tte()
- admiral::derive_summary_records()
- admiral::derive_extreme_event()
- admiral::derive_vars_joined()
- admiral::derive_vars_joined_summary()
- admiral::derive_vars_merged()
- admiral::derive_vars_crit_flag()
- admiral::derive_var_trtemfl() (now showcasing all scenarios discussed in the [PHUSE White Paper on Treatment-Emergent AEs](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Safety+Analytics/WP-087+Recommended+Definition+of++Treatment-Emergent+Adverse+Events+in+Clinical+Trials+.pdf)!
- admiral::derive_param_computed()
- admiral::derive_vars_dt()
- admiral::derive_vars_dt()
- admiral::derive_var_extreme_flag()

This is not to say that the other functions do not have examples anymore; rather, they retain the previous material. 

Now, our aim as a development team is to continually enhance the reference examples of our large portfolio of functions regularly across release cycles. If you'd like to play a part, this is also a great opportunity to contribute to {admiral} yourself - please get in touch with our development team through [Slack](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/) or our [Github repo](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/) and we'd be happy to help you get started.

We've also made various other small documentation enhancements, which you can peruse in the [Changelog](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/main/news/index.html).

## New Function

But we haven't stopped there! Here's what else is new in {admiral} 1.3:

- We've enhanced our catalog of functions with a new addition: admiral::derive_vars_joined_summary(). This function is similar to admiral::derive_vars_joined(), but allows the derivation of summary variables (e.g. cumulative sum, etc) rather than variables using a formula. For instance, here's an example derivation in ADAE of `CUMDOSA`, the cumulative dose received up until an adverse event:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(admiral)

adex <- tribble(
  ~USUBJID, ~ADY, ~AVAL,
  "1",         1,    10,
  "1",         8,    20,
  "1",        15,    10,
  "2",         8,     5
)

adae <- tribble(
  ~USUBJID, ~ADY, ~AEDECOD,
  "1",         2, "Fatigue",
  "1",         9, "Influenza",
  "1",        15, "Theft",
  "1",        15, "Fatigue",
  "2",         4, "Parasomnia",
  "3",         2, "Truancy"
)

derive_vars_joined_summary(
  dataset = adae,
  dataset_add = adex,
  by_vars = exprs(USUBJID),
  filter_join = ADY.join <= ADY,
  join_type = "all",
  join_vars = exprs(ADY),
  new_vars = exprs(CUMDOSA = sum(AVAL, na.rm = TRUE))
)
```

- We now provide new lab grading metadata specifically tailored for US (Conventional) units across three grading criteria: NCI-CTCAEv4 (`atoxgr_criteria_ctcv4_uscv`), NCI-CTCAEv5 (`atoxgr_criteria_ctcv5_uscv`), and DAIDs (`atoxgr_criteria_daids_uscv`).
- Default values for function arguments are now always displayed in argument descriptions.

## Breaking Changes

Excluding deprecations, we have only two small breaking changes: 

- We've renamed `SI_UNIT_CHECK` to `UNIT_CHECK` in lab grading metadata variables: `atoxgr_criteria_ctcv4()`, `atoxgr_criteria_ctcv5()`, and `atoxgr_criteria_daids()` to simplify specifications. 
- The values of the variable specified for `tmp_obs_nr_var` in admiral::derive_vars_joined(), admiral::derive_var_joined_exist_flag() and admiral::filter_joined() are now populated differently if there are multiple records in `dataset` or `dataset_add` for the same values of `by_vars` and order. Before each of these records was assigned a different value, i.e., the variable (together with `by_vars`) was a unique identifier. Now the value is the same for all these records.

We've also started pre-alerting users of an upcoming breaking change to the default behavior of admiral::derive_vars_dtm() in our next release (1.4.0), where we'll switch the default value of `ignore_seconds_flag` from `FALSE` to `TRUE`. Ahead of this change, admiral::derive_vars_dtm() now issues a helpful message informing users of the upcoming change, to allowing mitigation ahead of time. 

## Updates of existing functions and bug fixes

We've also been busy updating some of our existing functions in response to bug fixes and requests for enhancements. One particular update of note was to admiral::derive_locf_records, which now comes with two new arguments `id_vars_ref` and `imputation.` The `id_vars_ref` argument allows users to select the variables to group by in the reference dataset when determining which observations to add to the input dataset. The `imputation` argument lets users decide whether to update `analysis_var` when its value is `NA` ("update" and "update_add"), or to add a new observation instead ("add").

You can find the full list of updates in the [Changelog](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/main/news/index.html).

## Conclusion

We've been truly thrilled with the amount of user feedback and engagement with the package in the last six months, which is a big reason for the amount of content in this new release. As such, we're super excited to finally make {admiral} 1.3 available to the pharmaverse community, and look forward to continuing to co-create {admiral} together!
