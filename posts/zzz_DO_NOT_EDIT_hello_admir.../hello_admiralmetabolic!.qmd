# Introduction

The {admiral} team is excited to celebrate the newest addition to the our extension package family with the release {admiralmetabolic} 0.1! This new package focuses on the therapeutic areas of obesity and cardiovascular metabolism, and was borne out of a collaboration between Novo Nordisk and Roche, as well as a number of independent contributors. {admiralmetabolic} addresses a key unmet need in this area given the ever-increasing interest in obesity and cardiovascular metabolism across the industry.

# Package Contents

For this first 0.1 release, {admiralmetabolic} focuses primarily on the obesity indication. The package offers:

* SDTM obesity-specific test data (to be moved to {pharmaversesdtm} at the next release of the package);
* Two brand-new functions: admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthgt() and admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthip();
* Two vignettes for an [obesity vital signs ADaM ADVS](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralmetabolic/articles/advs.html) and a [Control of Eating Questionnaire ADaM ADCOEQ](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralmetabolic/articles/adcoeq.html);
* Two template programs for [ADVS](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralmetabolic/blob/main/inst/templates/ad_advs.R) and [ADCOEQ](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralmetabolic/blob/main/inst/templates/ad_adcoeq.R) matching the corresponding vignettes.

## New Functions

The first function, admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthgt(), is a wrapper to admiral::derive_param_computed() and enables users to add derived waist to height ratio parameters to a vital signs ADVS ADaM using waist circumference and height records. Here is an example of the function in action:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(tibble)
library(admiralmetabolic)

# Example 1: Derive Waist to Height Ratio where Height is measured only once

advs <- tribble(
  ~USUBJID, ~PARAMCD, ~PARAM, ~AVAL, ~AVALU, ~VISIT,
  "01-101-1001", "HEIGHT", "Height (cm)", 147, "cm", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1001", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (cm)", 110, "cm", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1001", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (cm)", 108, "cm", "WEEK 2",
  "01-101-1001", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (cm)", 107, "cm", "WEEK 3",
  "01-101-1002", "HEIGHT", "Height (cm)", 163, "cm", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1002", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (cm)", 120, "cm", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1002", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (cm)", 118, "cm", "WEEK 2",
  "01-101-1002", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (cm)", 117, "cm", "WEEK 3",
)

derive_param_waisthgt(
  advs,
  by_vars = exprs(USUBJID, VISIT),
  wstcir_code = "WSTCIR",
  height_code = "HEIGHT",
  set_values_to = exprs(
    PARAMCD = "WAISTHGT",
    PARAM = "Waist to Height Ratio"
  ),
  constant_by_vars = exprs(USUBJID),
  get_unit_expr = admiral::extract_unit(PARAM)
)
```

Note that this function has built-in support to:

* Calculate the ratio in cases where units differ across the numerator and denominator by converting on the fly (allowed units: m, mm, ft, in);
* Work in cases such as pediatric studies where both waist circumference and height are measured at multiple visits, by modifying the argument `constant_by_vars`. Please visit the function's reference page for more details.

admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthip() is very similar: it is also a wrapper to admiral::derive_param_computed(), but this time enables users to add derived waist to hit ratio parameters to a vital signs ADVS ADaM using waist circumference and hip records. This function does not have the `constant_by_vars` parameter as the ratio is taken from two parameters that are measured at every visit, unlike for admiral::derive_param_waisthgt() where height could conceivably only be measured at screening for non pediatric trials. However, it boasts the same unit-flexibility as admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthght() - let's looks at that in action:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
advs2 <- tribble(
  ~USUBJID, ~PARAMCD, ~PARAM, ~AVAL, ~AVALU, ~VISIT,
  "01-101-1001", "HIPCIR", "Hip Circumference (cm)", 125, "cm", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1001", "HIPCIR", "Hip Circumference (cm)", 124, "cm", "WEEK 2",
  "01-101-1001", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (in)", 43.31, "in", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1001", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (in)", 42.52, "in", "WEEK 2",
  "01-101-1002", "HIPCIR", "Hip Circumference (cm)", 135, "cm", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1002", "HIPCIR", "Hip Circumference (cm)", 133, "cm", "WEEK 2",
  "01-101-1002", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (in)", 47.24, "in", "SCREENING",
  "01-101-1002", "WSTCIR", "Waist Circumference (in)", 46.46, "in", "WEEK 2"
)

derive_param_waisthip(
  advs2,
  by_vars = exprs(USUBJID, VISIT),
  wstcir_code = "WSTCIR",
  hipcir_code = "HIPCIR",
  set_values_to = exprs(
    PARAMCD = "WAISTHIP",
    PARAM = "Waist to Hip Ratio"
  ),
  get_unit_expr = admiral::extract_unit(PARAM)
)
```

## Vignettes and Template

On the {admiralmetabolic} package website, users will find the [obesity ADVS vignette](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralmetabolic/articles/advs.html). This documentation page will guide users towards creating an obesity ADVS ADaM, touching upon how to use our two new functions admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthgt() and admiralmetabolic::derive_param_waisthip() as well as how to apply existing {admiral} tools such as the brand-new (as of [admiral 1.2](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2025-01-17_1.2_admiral.../1.2_admiral_release.html)) admiral::derive_vars_cat() to create weight classes within the AVALCAT variable and admiral::derive_vars_crit_flag() to create criterion flag/variable pairs for endpoints such as a 5% reduction in weight at a certain visit.

Of course, this vignette is coupled with the [obesity ADVS template program](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralmetabolic/blob/main/inst/templates/ad_advs.R), which users can use as a starting point for their ADaM scripts. The template can also be loaded and saved directly from the R console by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
admiral::use_ad_template("ADVS", package = "admiralmetabolic")
```

The [Control of Eating Questionnaire](https://licensing.leeds.ac.uk/product/control-of-eating-questionnaire-coeq) (COEQ) is used in many obesity trials as an endpoint. As such, {admiralmetabolic} also contains a second vignette geared towards the creation of an ADaM dataset ADCOEQ for the COEQ. Due to the flexibility of the parent {admiral} package, we saw no reason nor need to implement specific new functions for ADCOEQ. Indeed, functions such as admiral::derive_summary_records() can easily be employed to create ADCOEQ. Users are invited to visit the [vignette](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralmetabolic/articles/adcoeq.html) for more details and a full walkthrough. 

Once again, this vignette comes hand-in-hand with the [ADCOEQ program](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralmetabolic/blob/main/inst/templates/ad_advs.R), which can be accessed through the link above or directly from the R console by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
admiral::use_ad_template("ADCOEQ", package = "admiralmetabolic")
```

# Conclusion

We love growing the {admiral} family, and hope you are just as excited about {admiralmetabolic} as we are, and welcome any community feedback about the package, its contents and development directions for future releases. The development team will be meeting in the next month for a retrospective and a plan for the next release, so please reach out! 

Finally, if you have any suggestion new extension packages, or indeed would like to drive one yourself, please reach out to any member of the {admiral} team and we'd be happy to discuss next steps with you.
