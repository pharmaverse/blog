### What is [aNCA](https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA)?

The [aNCA](https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA) package is an open source tool developed in collaboration between Roche, Appsilon, and Human Predictions. This new addition to the [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) is designed to simplify Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA), making it more accessible for all scientists across industries.

### **The aNCA package empowers users to:**

-   Perform NCA on both non-clinical and clinical data
-   Automatically calculate PK parameters for various dosing regimens
-   Conduct manual selections and exclusions for lambda-z regression
-   Visualize results dynamically with editable plots and summary tables
-   Export PK parameters into a comprehensive, ready-to-use reports

This tool is built using `shiny` with user-friendliness in mind, allowing both novice and experienced users to seamlessly integrate it into their workflows.

<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
