We're thrilled to announce that `teal` v0.15.0 has been released on CRAN!

This marks a significant milestone in our journey, and we're incredibly excited about the possibilities `teal` brings to the R community, particularly within clinical trial settings.

One of the most notable changes in this release is the introduction of `teal_data` class. This addition enhances how data is handled within the `teal` framework, paving the way for custom data modules tailored to the needs of our R users, both inside and outside the clinical trial space. With `teal_data`, users can expect improved efficiency and flexibility in managing their data, opening doors to innovative approaches in data analysis and visualization.

While we're enthusiastic about the advancements `teal` v0.15.0 brings, we have to introduce breaking changes to this version.

But worry not, we've got you covered!

To ease the transition, we've provided comprehensive guidance on migrating your applications from version 0.14.0 to 0.15.0. Check out our migration guide [here](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal/discussions/945), and feel free to ask any questions you may have in the discussion thread.

As we roll out `teal` v0.15.0, we're also working diligently on releasing *teal modules* packages to CRAN to fully support this version. While we're still in the process, we encourage you to dive into the latest `teal` release and start exploring its capabilities. To get started, make sure to install the development versions of `teal.transform`, `teal.reporter`, and any other modules you're using.

To simplify the process, you can execute the following code to verify that you have the correct `teal` and *teal modules* versions:
```r
# installing latest stable release from CRAN
install.packages(c("teal.logger", "teal.code", "teal.widgets", "teal.data", "teal.slice", "teal"))

# installing dev version from pharmaverse
install.packages(c("teal.reporter", "teal.transform", "teal.modules.general", "teal.modules.clinical"), repos = c("https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```

Rest assured, we're committed to completing the release of the *teal modules* as swiftly as possible to provide users with an uninterrupted experience.

As always, thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm for `teal`. We can't wait to see the incredible ways in which `teal` empowers you to revolutionize your data exploration in R.
