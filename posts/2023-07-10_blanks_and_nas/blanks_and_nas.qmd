<!--------------- typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2023-07-10_blanks_and_nas"
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

Reading in SAS-based datasets (`.sas7bdat` or `xpt`) into R has users 
calling the R package [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/).  A typical call might invoke `read_sas()` or `read_xpt()`
to bring in your source data to construct your ADaMs or SDTMs.

Unfortunately, while using [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) the character blanks (missing data) found in a typical SAS-based dataset are left as blanks These blanks will typically prove problematic while using functions like `is.na` in combination with `dplyr::filter()` to subset data.

In the [admiral](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/) package, we have built a simple function called `convert_blanks_to_na()` to help us quickly remedy this problem. You can supply an entire dataframe to this function and it will convert any character blanks to `NA_character_`

## Loading Packages and Making Dummy Data

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(admiral)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)

df <- tribble(
  ~USUBJID, ~RFICDTC,
  "01", "2000-01-01",
  "02", "2001-01-01",
  "03", "", # Here we have a character blank
  "04", "2001-01--",
  "05", "2001---01",
  "05", "", # Here we have a character blank
)

df
```

## A simple conversion 

```{r}
df_na <- convert_blanks_to_na(df)

df_na
```

```{r}
df_na %>% filter(is.na(RFICDTC))
```

## That's it!

A simple call to this function can make your derivation life so much easier while working in R if working with SAS-based datasets. In admiral, we make use of this function at the start of all ADaM templates for common ADaM datasets. You can use the function `use_ad_template()` to get the full R script for the below ADaMs.

```{r}
list_all_templates()
```



<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug
)
```
