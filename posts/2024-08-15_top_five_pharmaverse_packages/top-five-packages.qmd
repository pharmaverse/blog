The [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) is a collaborative project where leading pharmaceutical companies and passionate individuals come together to create helpful tools for [clinical reporting](https://posit.co/blog/pharmaverse-packages-for-clinical-reporting-workflows/).
By **using R programming and the open-source community**, the [pharmaverse](https://github.com/pharmaverse/) makes it easier to gain insights and increase transparency in the pharma industry.

In this post, let's explore the **top 5 [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) packages** (by GitHub Stars ⭐), their interesting features, and how they can be used in clinical data analysis and reporting.

## **{rtables}: Crafting Regulatory-Ready Tables**

![](images/rtables.png){width="263"}

Let’s start our journey with [{rtables}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables), a package contributed by [Roche](https://www.roche.com/), which enables the creation of tables for reporting clinical trials.
It offers a flexible and efficient way to generate publication-quality tables, simplifying the reporting process and ensuring consistency across different trials.

[{rtables}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables) was primarily designed to address the needs of the pharmaceutical industry for creating regulatory-ready tables for clinical trial reporting.
**You can use it to generate tables to summarize patient demographics, adverse events, efficacy endpoints, and other clinical trial data.**

### **Features of {rtables}**

The [{rtables}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables) package offers several features that make it a useful tool for creating complex tables:

-   [{rtables}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables) allows you to define tables with a **hierarchical, tree-like structure**, enabling the creation of multi-level tables with nested rows and columns.

-   Each cell in an rtable can contain any high-dimensional data structure, and you can apply custom formatting, such as rounding, alignment, and cell spans, to individual cells.

-   It **supports various output formats**, including HTML, ASCII, LaTeX, and PDF, allowing you to generate tables that can be easily integrated into reports, presentations, and shiny applications.

-   The values in an rtable are **stored in a non-rounded state**, supporting cross-checking and further analysis.

-   This package is **designed to work with CDISC standards**, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it into your clinical data reporting workflows.

### **Example Code**

The following example demonstrates how to create a basic table using the [{rtables}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables) package.
We start by installing and loading the required libraries. 

Next, we create a simulated dataset representing clinical trial data.
We then define a function to calculate the mean of a biomarker and use [{rtables}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables) functions to build and print the table.

```
# Install rtables if it's not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("rtables", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("rtables")
}

# Load required library
library(rtables)

# Create a simulated dataset
set.seed(123)
ex_adsl <- data.frame(
  ARM = sample(c("Placebo", "Drug X", "Combination"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  BMRKR2 = sample(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  RACE = sample(c("Asian", "Black", "White"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  SEX = sample(c("Male", "Female"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  BMRKR1 = rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2)
)

# Define a function to calculate the mean of a biomarker
biomarker_ave <- function(x, ...) {
  val <- if (length(x) > 0) round(mean(x), 2) else "no data"
  in_rows("Biomarker 1 (mean)" = rcell(val))
}

# Create the table
table <- basic_table() |>
  split_cols_by("ARM") |>
  split_cols_by("BMRKR2") |>
  add_colcounts() |>
  split_rows_by("RACE", split_fun = trim_levels_in_group("SEX")) |>
  split_rows_by("SEX") |>
  summarize_row_groups() |>
  analyze("BMRKR1", biomarker_ave) |>
  build_table(ex_adsl)

# Print the table
print(table)
```

We start by loading the necessary libraries and creating a sample study dataset.
We then derive the ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset) and add additional variables for further analysis.

```
library(admiral)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Sample study data
study_data <- tibble::tribble(
  ~USUBJID, ~AGE, ~SEX, ~ARM, ~RANDDTC, ~RAND2DTC, ~VISIT, ~VISITDY, ~VSDTC, ~VSTPT, ~VSORRESU, ~VSORRES, ~PARAMCD,
  "01", 34, "M", "Placebo", "2022-12-10", "2023-01-15", "Screening", -7, "2023-01-08", "Pre-dose", "kg", 80, "WEIGHT",
  "02", 45, "F", "Treatment", "2023-01-02", "2023-01-17", "Baseline", 1, "2023-01-17", "Pre-dose", "kg", 65, "WEIGHT",
  "03", 54, "F", "", "2022-10-16", "2023-01-09", "Screening", -7, "2023-01-09", "Pre-dose", "kg", 78, "WEIGHT"
)

# Function to aggregate by age group
format_agegr1 <- function(var_input) {
  case_when(
    var_input < 35 ~ "<35",
    between(var_input, 34, 50) ~ "35-49",
    var_input > 50 ~ ">64",
    TRUE ~ "Missing"
  )
}

# Derive ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)
adsl <- study_data |>
  select(USUBJID, AGE, SEX, ARM, RANDDTC, RAND2DTC) |>
  distinct() |>
  # Convert blanks strings to NA
  convert_blanks_to_na() |>
  # admiral does not yet support aggregation function, but dplyr can be used
  mutate(
    AGEGR1 = format_agegr1(AGE)
  ) |>
  # Convert from character to DATE
  derive_vars_dt(
    dtc = RANDDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "TRTS"
  ) |>
  derive_vars_dt(
    dtc = RAND2DTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "TRTE"
  ) |>
  derive_vars_duration(
    new_var = TRTD,
    start_date = TRTSDT,
    end_date = TRTEDT,
    add_one = FALSE
  )

# Display the ADSL dataset
print(adsl)
```
