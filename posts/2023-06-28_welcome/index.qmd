<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "2023-06-28_welcome"
# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

## Purpose

The communications working group (CWG) seeks to promote and showcase how R can be used in the Clinical Reporting pipeline through short and informative blog posts.  These posts will be hosted on this [pharmaverse blog](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/) and promoted on the pharmaverse slack channels as well as on LinkedIn.

As the CWG is a small team, we hope to make the blog development process easy enough that pharmaverse community members will be able to easily write blog posts with guidance from the CWG team.

## Spirit of a Blog Post

The CWG believes that the following 4 points will help guide the creation of Blog Posts. 

* **Short**
* **Personalized**
* **Reproducible**
* **Readable**  

**Short:** Posts should aim to be under a 10 minute read. We encourage longer posts to be broken up into multiple posts.  

**Personalized:** Posts should have a personality! For example, a person wishing to post on a function in a package needs to differentiate the post from the documentation for function, i.e. we don't want to just recycle the documentation. How can you add your voice and experience? A bit of cheeky language is also encouraged.

**Reproducible:**  Posts should work with minimal dependencies with data, packages and outside sources. Every dependency introduced in a post adds some risk to the post longevity. As package dependencies change, posts should be built in a way that they can be updated to stay relevant.

**Readable:** The CWG sees this site as more of introductory site rather advanced user site. Therefore, the CWG feels that code should be introduced in a way that promotes readability over complexity. 


## What types of posts are allowed on this site?

Overall, we want to stay focus on the Clinical Reporting Pipeline, which we see as the following topics:

1) Packages in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline
2) Functions from packages in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline
3) Wider experiences of using R in the Clinical Reporting Pipeline
4) Conference experiences and the Clinical Reporting Pipeline

However, it never hurts to ask if you topic might fit into this medium!

### Minimum Post Requirements

  * A unique image to help showcase the post.
  * Working Code
  * Self-contained data or package data.
  * Documentation of package versions

That is it! After that you can go wild, but we do ask that it is kept short!

## How can I make a Blog Post

Step 1: Reach out to us through [pharmaverse/slack](pharmaverse.slack.com
) or make an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/blog/issues).

Step 2: Branch off `main`

Step 3: Review the Spirit of the Blog Post in the Pull Request Template

Step 4: Poke us to do a review!  



<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
