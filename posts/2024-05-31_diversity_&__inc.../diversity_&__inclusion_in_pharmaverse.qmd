<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Throughout the pharmaverse journey, our focus has always been on achieving
equity across pharma, biotech, charity groups and more. We’ve strived to enable
any company, no matter how big or small, to prepare clinical trial reporting
using cutting edge and freely available solutions in R. The ultimate ambition
being that the best treatments have the best chance of reaching patients all
over the world. However, in our focus on this mission we took our eyes off other
forms of equity – such as the gender diversity of our representatives.

Diversity is not a new issue in open source – for example there has long been
an uneven gender representation across many communities and initiatives in this
space. Given the growing influence of pharmaverse we want to strive to use our
platform to not further any such imbalance.

With respect to gender diversity, the pharmaverse council is currently formed of
7 male members. Our council is and always has been open to any individual put
forth by an organization, and anyone who wants to volunteer in the Pharmaverse
is welcome. If this perception has differed, then we have to do our part to
ensure anyone feels comfortable bringing their contribution forth and engaging
in our community.

Representation starts from the top, and as council members complete their 2-year
terms, we will advocate within our companies for more diverse candidates to be
proactively encouraged to step forward for consideration.

We are committed to using our influence to ensure everyone has an equal
opportunity to make a difference in our community at all levels, so this
discussion has to continue across package development teams and all the various
ways people can contribute.

To close, we’d like to reflect on the past years by saying that the true
strength of what has been built here is not from us on the council, or from the
packages or the developers, it really comes from the whole community being
built. This is a community of like-minded people that have come together from
all walks of life passionate to make a difference and change the siloed trends
of our industry. That is what makes the pharmaverse, and we hope that everyone
no matter what demographic you belong to feels welcome to join and give your
free time to help do more for ALL patients across the world.

Yours faithfully,

pharmaverse council
