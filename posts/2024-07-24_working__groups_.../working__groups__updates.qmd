# renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Hi community,

We wanted to share with you an update from council discussions around our
pharmaverse working groups. Up until now, these have been the decision-holders of
which packages are included/excluded from the pharmaverse. Although open for
all to join, they ended up being quite lean and likely not representative of the
true depth of this community. So we’ve decided to open up the package decisions
to our full community in future via our [Slack workspace](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/), to make for a more
inclusive community where everyone has a voice. This is now updated on our
website – see the FAQ section on the [homepage](https://pharmaverse.org/).

Moving forwards, instead of working groups we will maintain some
[sub-communities](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/wg/)
for particular connected networks such as our package maintainers, but we plan
to channel any working group type energy towards
[PHUSE DVOST](https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=327777)
given our strong partnership with PHUSE.

So, please do look out for future package applications to pharmaverse that will
be shared in our Slack general channel and we welcome your input to help make
the call on which to accept/decline – after all pharmaverse belongs to us all!

On behalf of the pharmaverse council


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
