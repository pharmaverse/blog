Hi community,

We wanted to share with you an update from council discussions around our
pharmaverse working groups. Up until now, these have been the decision-holders of
which packages are included/excluded from the pharmaverse. Although open for
all to join, they ended up being quite lean and likely not representative of the
true depth of this community. So we’ve decided to open up the package decisions
to our full community in future via our [Slack workspace](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/),
to make for a more inclusive community where everyone has a voice. This is now
updated on our website – see the FAQ section on the [homepage](https://pharmaverse.org/).

We don't want to be overly prescriptive with how this process will work as it
might evolve over time, but we'll be openly sharing any future package
applications to pharmaverse via our Slack and we welcome your input to help make
the call on which to accept/decline. Any individual from our community could
express support via a thumbs up on the GitHub issue or add a comment with any
concerns. If the requestor is unable to resolve any concerns, then ultimately
any contentious applications will be raised to the pharmaverse council to
adjudicate. The final decision and rationale will then always be documented on
the issue.

Moving forwards, instead of working groups we will maintain some
[sub-communities](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/wg/)
for particular connected networks such as our package maintainers, or those
teams powering pharmaverse-specifics such as our blog and website.
Additionally, for any wider open source industry challenges we would recommend
any would-be contributors towards
[PHUSE DVOST](https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=327777),
given our strong and continued partnership with PHUSE.

Note that the above does not impact the role of the pharmaverse council - all
our accountabilities are still explained [here](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/council/).
Now only we delegate the responsibility for "curation" of pharmaverse packages
to our entire community.

On behalf of the pharmaverse council


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
