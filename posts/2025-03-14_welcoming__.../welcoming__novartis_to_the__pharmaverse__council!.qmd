Hi pharmaverse community,

Weâ€™re excited to welcome Novartis as the newest member of the Pharmaverse Council! Representing Novartis on the council will be Orla Doyle.

Novartis has been a strong advocate for integrating open-source languages and tools into regulatory processes. Their commitment to the open-source community continues to grow, with contributions to various initiatives, direct support for open-source packages, and knowledge-sharing from their experience with their work on R-based workflows. We truly appreciate their ongoing support in advancing open-source collaboration.

Now a short introduction to Orla Doyle, joining the Pharmaverse Council on behalf of Novartis. Orla joined Novartis in 2021. She is part of Advanced Quantitative Sciences where she supports programmers and statisticians in the adoption of open-source tools from trial design to analysis and reporting. Orla holds a PhD in Biomedical Engineering. Prior to joining Novartis, Orla worked at IQVIA, applying machine learning methods to clinical trials and real-world data.

She has played a key role in encouraging Novartis teams to engage in open-source contributions and is committed to fostering the growth of our community. We look forward to strengthening our collaboration across the industry and advancing the development of actively maintained packages.

Please join us in giving a warm welcome to Orla!
