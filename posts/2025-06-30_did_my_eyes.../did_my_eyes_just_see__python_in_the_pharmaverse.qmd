Hi pharmaverse community!

The eagle-eyed among you might have noticed in recent months updated wording
on our [pharmaverse charter](https://pharmaverse.org/charter/) and generally
across our website to generalize our scope to "open-source software packages and
codebases".

As part of this, we released our first ever dedicated page to an open source
language other than R, with our
[Python page](https://pharmaverse.org/e2eclinical/python/). Here you can explore
the first pharmaverse offerings in this space:

- [py-pkglite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/py-pkglite/) - helping support
creation of submission readable code.
- [rtflite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/) - enabling production of RTF
outputs.

Special thanks to Nan Xiao here as a pioneering member of our community!
We look forward to further Python solutions being proposed for pharmaverse
inclusion in future.

**So, what does this mean for R?**

We remain committed to focusing on R, but if ever we can help lift up other open
source efforts we're open to it. In this case, no equivalent "pharmaverse for
Python" existed so we were happy to agree to host these codebases on our GitHub
org to allow this area of open source collaboration to flourish.

We often get asked about expanding our scope beyond R for clinical reporting, and
over time naturally this is likely, whilst not wanting to ever fall into the trap
of trying to boil the ocean and losing what makes pharmaverse special. Especially
given so many amazing other efforts are out there which we can leverage, as we detail
on our site [here](https://pharmaverse.org/opensource/).

If you ever have further ideas for pharmaverse scope, please don't hesitate to
reach out to the council at <a href="mailto:pharmaverse.council@phuse.global">pharmaverse.council@phuse.global</a>.


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
