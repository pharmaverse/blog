# Introduction

Date and time is collected in SDTM as character values using the extended [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format `"yyyy-dd-mmThh:mm:ss"`. This universal format allows missing parts date or time - e.g. the string`"2019-10"` represents a date where the day and the time are unknown. In contrast, ADaM timing variables like `ADTM` (Analysis Datetime) or `ADY` (Analysis Relative Day) are numeric variables, which can be derived only if the date or datetime is complete. 

Most ADaM programmers have, at one point or another, encountered situations where missing dates, unexpected formats or confusing imputation functions rendered derivations of timing variables frustrating and time consuming. `{admiral}` aims to mitigate this (where possible!) by providing functions which automatically derive date/datetime variables for you, and fill in missing date or time parts according to well-defined imputation rules.

In this article, we first examine the arsenal of functions provided by`{admiral}` to aid in datetime imputation and timing variable derivation. We then observe everything in action through a number of selected typical examples.

# Date/Datetime Derivation and Imputation Functions

`{admiral}` provides the following functions for date/datetime imputation:

- `derive_vars_dt()`: Adds a date variable and a date imputation flag variable (optional) based on a --DTC variable and imputation rules.
- `derive_vars_dtm()`: Adds a datetime variable, a date imputation flag variable, and a time imputation flag variable (both optional) based on a --DTC variable and imputation rules.
- `impute_dtc_dtm()`: Returns a complete ISO 8601 datetime or `NA` based on a partial ISO 8601 datetime and imputation rules.
- `impute_dtc_dt()`: Returns a complete ISO 8601 date (without time) or `NA` based on a partial ISO 8601 date(time) and imputation rules.
- `convert_dtc_to_dt()`: Returns a date if the input ISO 8601 date is complete. Otherwise, `NA` is returned.
- `convert_dtc_to_dtm()`: Returns a datetime if the input ISO 8601 date is complete (with missing time replaced by `"00:00:00"` as default). Otherwise, NA is returned.
- `compute_dtf()`: Returns the date imputation flag.
- `compute_tmf()`: Returns the time imputation flag.

From the point of view of a typical ADaM programmer, the functions `impute_*`, `convert_*` and `compute_*` above can be viewed as utilities for treating dates and/or imputation within any custom code. In contrast, their `derive_*` find their use in directly deriving new timing variables and/or carrying out imputation at an ADaM dataset scale.

# Action Examples

## Creating an Imputed Datetime and Date Variable and Imputation Flag Variables

As described previously, `derive_vars_dtm()` derives an imputed datetime variable and the corresponding date and time imputation flags. The imputed date variable can then be derived by using `derive_vars_dtm_to_dt()`. It is not necessary and advisable to perform the imputation for the date variable if it was already done for the datetime variable. CDISC considers the datetime and the date variable as two representations of the same date. Thus the imputation must be the same and the imputation flags are valid for both the datetime and the date variable.

```{r}
library(admiral)
library(lubridate)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

ae <- tribble(
  ~AESTDTC,
  "2019-08-09T12:34:56",
  "2019-04-12",
  "2010-09",
  NA_character_
) %>%
  derive_vars_dtm(
    dtc = AESTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "AST",
    highest_imputation = "M",
    date_imputation = "first",
    time_imputation = "first"
  ) %>%
  derive_vars_dtm_to_dt(exprs(ASTDTM))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(ae)
```

## Creating an Imputed Date Variable and Imputation Flag Variable

If an imputed date variable without a corresponding datetime variable is required, it can be derived by the `derive_vars_dt()` function.

```{r}
ae <- tribble(
  ~AESTDTC,
  "2019-08-09T12:34:56",
  "2019-04-12",
  "2010-09",
  NA_character_
) %>%
  derive_vars_dt(
    dtc = AESTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "AST",
    highest_imputation = "M",
    date_imputation = "first"
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(ae)
```

## Imputing Time without Imputing Date

If the time should be imputed but not the date, the `highest_imputation` argument should be set to `"h"`. This results in `NA` if the date is partial. As no date is imputed the date imputation flag is not created.

```{r}
ae <- tribble(
  ~AESTDTC,
  "2019-08-09T12:34:56",
  "2019-04-12",
  "2010-09",
  NA_character_
) %>%
  derive_vars_dtm(
    dtc = AESTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "AST",
    highest_imputation = "h",
    time_imputation = "first"
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(ae)
```

## Avoiding Imputed Dates Before a Particular Date
Usually an adverse event start date is imputed as the earliest date of all possible dates when filling the missing parts. The result may be a date before treatment start date. This is not desirable because the adverse event would not be considered as treatment emergent and excluded from the adverse event summaries. This can be avoided by specifying the treatment start date variable (`TRTSDTM`) for the `min_dates` argument.

Importantly, `TRTSDTM` is used as imputed date only if the non missing date and time parts of `AESTDTC` coincide with those of `TRTSDTM`. Therefore `2019-10` is not imputed as `2019-11-11 12:34:56`. This ensures that collected information is not changed by the imputation.

```{r}
ae <- tribble(
  ~AESTDTC,              ~TRTSDTM,
  "2019-08-09T12:34:56", ymd_hms("2019-11-11T12:34:56"),
  "2019-10",             ymd_hms("2019-11-11T12:34:56"),
  "2019-11",             ymd_hms("2019-11-11T12:34:56"),
  "2019-12-04",          ymd_hms("2019-11-11T12:34:56")
) %>%
  derive_vars_dtm(
    dtc = AESTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "AST",
    highest_imputation = "M",
    date_imputation = "first",
    time_imputation = "first",
    min_dates = exprs(TRTSDTM)
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(ae)
```

## Avoiding Imputed Dates After a Particular Date

If a date is imputed as the latest date of all possible dates when filling the missing parts, it should not result in dates after data cut off or death. This can be achieved by specifying the dates for the `max_dates` argument.

Importantly, non missing date parts are not changed. Thus `2019-12-04` is imputed as `2019-12-04 23:59:59` although it is after the data cut off date. It may make sense to replace it by the data cut off date but this is not part of the imputation. It should be done in a separate data cleaning or data cut off step.
```{r}
ae <- tribble(
  ~AEENDTC,              ~DTHDT,            ~DCUTDT,
  "2019-08-09T12:34:56", ymd("2019-11-11"), ymd("2019-12-02"),
  "2019-11",             ymd("2019-11-11"), ymd("2019-12-02"),
  "2019-12",             NA,                ymd("2019-12-02"),
  "2019-12-04",          NA,                ymd("2019-12-02")
) %>%
  derive_vars_dtm(
    dtc = AEENDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "AEN",
    highest_imputation = "M",
    date_imputation = "last",
    time_imputation = "last",
    max_dates = exprs(DTHDT, DCUTDT)
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(ae)
```

## Imputation Without Creating a New Variable

If imputation is required without creating a new variable the `convert_dtc_to_dt()` function can be called to obtain a vector of imputed dates. It can be used for example here:

```{r}
mh <- tribble(
  ~MHSTDTC,     ~TRTSDT,
  "2019-04",    ymd("2019-04-15"),
  "2019-04-01", ymd("2019-04-15"),
  "2019-05",    ymd("2019-04-15"),
  "2019-06-21", ymd("2019-04-15")
) %>%
  filter(
    convert_dtc_to_dt(
      MHSTDTC,
      highest_imputation = "M",
      date_imputation = "first"
    ) < TRTSDT
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(mh)
```

## Using More Than One Imputation Rule for a Variable

Using different imputation rules depending on the observation can be done by using the higher-order function `slice_derivation()`, which applies a derivation function differently (by varying its arguments) in different subsections of a dataset. For example, consider this Vital Signs case where pre-dose records require a different treatment to other records:

```{r}
vs <- tribble(
  ~VSDTC,                ~VSTPT,
  "2019-08-09T12:34:56", NA,
  "2019-10-12",          "PRE-DOSE",
  "2019-11-10",          NA,
  "2019-12-04",          NA
) %>%
  slice_derivation(
    derivation = derive_vars_dtm,
    args = params(
      dtc = VSDTC,
      new_vars_prefix = "A"
    ),
    derivation_slice(
      filter = VSTPT == "PRE-DOSE",
      args = params(time_imputation = "first")
    ),
    derivation_slice(
      filter = TRUE,
      args = params(time_imputation = "last")
    )
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(vs)
```
