We are thrilled to announce the release of {rtflite} 1.0.0,
marking a significant milestone in bringing production-ready
TLF generation capabilities in RTF format to Python for clinical trial reporting.
This major release represents our commitment to providing the pharmaceutical
industry with robust, reliable tools for creating tables, listings, and
figures (TLFs) in RTF format.

## What is rtflite?

{rtflite} is a Python package
designed specifically for generating TLFs in RTF format for clinical trial reporting.
Inspired by the {r2rtf}
it provides a programmatic interface to create highly customized TLFs that
meet regulatory submission requirements.
When used together with [pkglite for Python](https://pharmaverse.github.io/py-pkglite/),
[rtflite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/) bridges the gap between
Python's data science ecosystem and the specialized requirements of
clinical trial reporting and submission.

## Major enhancements in rtflite 1.0.0

### Pagination capabilities

With the `page_by`, `group_by`, and `subline_by` features in `RTFBody`
introduced in rtflite 1.0.0, we can efficiently create paginated TLFs
([examples](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/articles/advanced-group-by/#multi-page-example-with-group-context)).

### Embedding figures

With the `RTFFigure` feature introduced in rtflite 1.0.0,
we can embed multiple figures with titles, footnotes, and data sources
([examples](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/articles/example-figure/)).

### Table combination

`RTFDocument` now supports a list of tables. This allows
users to combine multiple tables to create advanced layouts
([examples](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/articles/example-figure/)).
