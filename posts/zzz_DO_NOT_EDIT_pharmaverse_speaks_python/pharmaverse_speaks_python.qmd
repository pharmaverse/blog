<!--------------- typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
long_slug <- "zzz_DO_NOT_EDIT_pharmaverse..."
library(link)
link::auto()
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Python code in pharmaverse... "but pharmaverse is based around R" you might be thinking. Well to start this blog, here's a statement on behalf of the council:

> We remain committed to focusing on R, but if ever we can help lift up other
> open source efforts we're open to it. In this case, no equivalent
> "pharmaverse for Python" exists so we were happy to agree to host these
> codebases on our GitHub org to allow this area of open source collaboration
> to flourish. We often get asked about expanding our scope beyond R for
> clinical reporting, and over time naturally this is likely, whilst not
> wanting to ever fall into the trap of trying to boil the ocean and losing
> what makes pharmaverse special. Especially given so many amazing other
> efforts are out there which we can leverage: <https://pharmaverse.org/opensource/>.



Please use the {link} package to automatically link packages and functions.
To link to a package simply wrap it in curly braces: {dplyr}.
Link a function from a package like: dplyr::filter().
For more information check out {link}.



<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "pharmaverse/blog",
  name = long_slug,
  # file_name should be the name of your file
  file_name = list.files() %>% stringr::str_subset(".qmd") %>% first()
)
```
