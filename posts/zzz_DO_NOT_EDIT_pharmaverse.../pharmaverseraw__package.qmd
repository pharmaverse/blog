## Background

The {pharmaversesdtm} and {pharmaverseadam} packages have been available
for some time, providing reusable examples for SDTM and ADaM datasets,
respectively. However, one critical piece of the workflow was missing:
the raw datasets that serve as the starting point for these examples.

## Why now?

With the recent release of the
[{sdtm.oak}](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtm.oak/) package — an
open-source package that enables SDTM programming in R — we now have an
opportunity to complete the picture. The new
[{pharmaverseraw}](https://pharmaverse.github.io/pharmaverseraw/)
package fills this gap by providing example raw datasets that can be
used as input for {pharmaversesdtm} datasets generation with {sdtm.oak}.

## What is in {pharmaverseraw}?

The {pharmaverseraw} package v0.1.0 is out on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pharmaverseraw/index.html).
It includes **raw datasets** for the following SDTM domains:

\- AE: Adverse Events

\- DS: Subject Disposition

\- DM: Demographics

\- EC/EX: Exposure

These raw datasets in {pharmaverseraw} package are intentionally
designed to be:

-   EDC agnostic: They are not tied to any specific Electronic Data
    Capture (EDC) system like Rave or Veeva.
-   Standards agnostic: Some variables follow CDASH (Clinical Data
    Acquisition Standards Harmonization), while others do not. This
    reflects real-world data standards variability across companies.

The **annotated case report forms** corresponding to the raw datasets
are also present in the `inst\acrf` folder. These PDF files illustrate
how each raw variable aligns with SDTM expectations, offering insight
into the mapping logic used in {sdtm.oak}.

## How are these datasets created?

The datasets in {pharmaverseraw} were created through **backward
engineering** - we started with the finalized SDTM datasets in
{pharmaversesdtm} and worked backward to construct plausible raw
datasets that could reasonably result in those SDTM outputs. This
approach ensures data consistency while allowing us to demonstrate the
flexibility of {sdtm.oak} in handling raw data in different formats.

## Get involved

Similar to the other tools under pharmaverse umbrella, the
{pharmaverseraw} package is open-source and community-driven. We welcome
volunteers who are interested in contributing to the continued
development and improvement of this package.

If you’d like to get involved, here are some ways you can help:

\- **Add new raw datasets:** Take other SDTM domains from the
{pharmaversesdtm} package and create corresponding raw datasets using R.
This will help expand the coverage of the package.

\- **Create mock aCRFs for the raw datasets:** Develop annotated case
report forms (aCRFs) that illustrate how the raw variables are mapped to
align with SDTM standards.

\- **Prepare documentation:** For each raw dataset you create, include
documentation that explains the data structure, variable definitions,
and any relevant notes.

Whether you're a programmer, CDISC expert, or clinical data manager,
your contributions can make a meaningful impact. Visit the [github
repository](https://github.com/pharmaverse/pharmaverseraw) to open up a
issue or start a discussion.
