### 🔍 Pharmaverse Examples Highlights

If you’re navigating the world of clinical reporting with modern tooling or are curious about how open-source tooling then the pharmaverse examples site is your one-stop-shop! This **living collection** of end-to-end examples showcases how open-source packages from the pharmaverse ecosystem work together to solve real clinical reporting challenges.

The site is organized into easy-to-navigate sections:

-   **SDTM** examples like DM (Demographics), VS (Vital Signs), AE (Adverse Events).

-   **ADaM** examples including ADSL (Subject Level), ADTTE (Time-to-Event) and ADVS (Vital Signs).

-   **TLG** examples showing how to build demographic tables, adverse event summaries, and pharmacokinetic displays.

-   **Interactive** content such as data visualization apps built with teal.

-   **Automated reporting** of outputs via slides or docs.

-   **eSubmission** for submission preparation.

Each example serves as a mini-tutorial with code snippets walking you through steps and letting you see how packages can be used in a realistic workflow.

### 💬 Why It Matters

Open source thrives on collaboration, and the pharmaverse ecosystem embodies this by **bringing developers and users together** to share tools, workflows, and best practices. The Examples site is a bridge between learning and doing—it helps users:

-   Understand how packages fit together

-   Forum to share how packages are used by different teams

-   Work towards reproducible, end to end workflows

All of this contributes to **faster, more reliable clinical reporting** and supports the broader mission of shared problem solved across the industry.
